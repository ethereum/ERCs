## Abstract

This ERC extends the Agent‑to‑Agent (A2A) Protocol <!-- TODO: where is the A2A protocol defined? --> with a trust layer that allows participants to **discover, choose, and interact with agents across organizational boundaries** without pre‑existing trust.  

It introduces three **lightweight, on‑chain registries**—Identity, Reputation, and Validation—and leaves application‑specific logic to off‑chain components.

Trust models are pluggable and tiered, with security proportional to value at risk—from low-stake tasks like ordering pizza to high-stake tasks like medical diagnosis. Developers can choose from three trust models: reputation-based systems using client feedback, stake-secured inference validation (crypto-economics), and attestations for agents running in TEEs (crypto-verifiability).

<!-- TODO: Your abstract is missing a high-level technical overview of _how_ your proposal accomplishes its goals. -->

## Motivation

The existing A2A protocol handles agent authentication, skills advertisement via AgentCards<!-- TODO: what's an AgentCard -->, direct messaging, and complete task-lifecycle orchestration. Its adoption by leading technology firms demonstrates clear market demand. However, the protocol currently operates within organizational boundaries and **assumes trust between Server Agent and Client Agent**.

To foster an open, cross-organizational agent economy, we need mechanisms for discovering and trusting agents in untrusted settings. This ERC addresses this need through three core components, which can be deployed on any L2 or on Mainnet:

**1\. Identity Registry** \- A minimal on-chain handle that resolves to an agent's off-chain AgentCard, providing every agent with a portable, censorship-resistant identifier.

**2\. Reputation Registry** \- A standard interface for posting and fetching attestations. Scoring and aggregation will likely occur off-chain, enabling an ecosystem of specialized services for agent scoring, auditor networks, and insurance pools.

**3\. Validation Registry** \- Generic hooks for requesting and recording independent checks through economic staking (validators re-running the job) or cryptographic proofs (TEEs attestations). The ERC defines only the interface, allowing any validation protocol to integrate seamlessly.

Payment layers <!-- Editor's Note: we prefer avoiding specific products in proposals. Since ERCs eventually become immutable, any products mentioned in them get an unfair advantage over products released after finalization. -->are orthogonal to this protocol and not covered here. However, payment proofs can enrich feedback attestations.

This ERC builds on approaches that the Web3 industry is already experimenting with, providing a unified interface and a comprehensive stack to accelerate ecosystem adoption of trustless agents.

## Specification

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119) and [RFC 8174](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8174).

### Participants

<!-- TODO: define "participant"; does it mean a human, contract, etc.? -->

All participants MUST register with the Identity Registry as a generic agent. Agents can have three roles: 

* Server Agent (A2A Server): Offers services and executes tasks  
* Client Agent (A2A Client): Assigns tasks to Server Agents and provides feedback  
* Validator Agent (Optional): Validates tasks through crypto-economic staking mechanisms (staking validators re-executing the inference) or cryptographic verification

Agents may fulfill multiple roles simultaneously without restriction.

### Identity Registry

All participants register on a smart contract on an EVM chain, which acts as a single entry point. Each agent is uniquely identified by:

* **AgentID:** Global identifier on the blockchain, assigned incrementally by the registry  
* **AgentDomain:** Following [RFC 8615](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8615) principles, an Agent Card MUST be available at `https://{AgentDomain}/.well-known/agent-card.json`  
* **AgentAddress:** EVM-compatible address identifying the agent

#### **Write Endpoints**

```
New(AgentDomain, AgentAddress) → AgentID
Update(AgentID, Optional NewAgentDomain, Optional NewAgentAddress) → Boolean
```

All write operations require the transaction sender to be `AgentAddress`.

#### **Public Resolvers**

```
Get(AgentID) → AgentID, AgentDomain, AgentAddress
ResolveByDomain(AgentDomain) → AgentID, AgentDomain, AgentAddress
ResolveByAddress(AgentAddress) → AgentID, AgentDomain, AgentAddress
```

#### **Agent Card Structure**

Using the concept of "Extension" as defined in the A2A Protocol specs, the Agent Card at the well-known URI SHOULD include a `registrations` array listing all blockchain registries:

```jsonc
"registrations": [
    { "agentId": 12345,
      "agentAddress": "eip155:1:0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc9e7595f0bEb7",
      "signature": "...proof of ownership of the address..."
      },
    { "agentId": 67890,
      "agentAddress": "eip155:59144:0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc9e7595f0bEb7",
      "signature": "...proof of ownership of the address..."
      }
  ]
```

The `agentAddress` field follows the [CAIP 10](https://github.com/ChainAgnostic/CAIPs/blob/b23e772369f2bc885c2ab70af4f0a0ec6bff6631/CAIPs/caip-10.md) account identifier standard: `{namespace}:{reference}:{address}`.

Additionally, following the A2A extensions pattern, the Agent Card SHOULD describe which trust models are supported when the agent acts as a Server Agent:

```json
"trustModels": ["feedback", "inference-validation", "tee-attestation"]
```

### Reputation Registry

The Registry provides a **lightweight entry point for task feedback between agents through off-chain attestations**.

To minimize on-chain costs, only essential data is stored on-chain. The registry exposes a single endpoint:

```
AcceptFeedback(AgentClientID, AgentServerID) → emits AuthFeedback event
```

This emits an `AuthFeedback` event with parameters `(AgentClientID, AgentServerID, FeedbackAuthID)`.

**Authorization Flow:** When a Server Agent accepts a task, it pre-authorizes the Client Agent to provide feedback upon task completion.

#### **Feedback Data Structure**

Each feedback-providing Client Agent’s Agent Card MUST extend A2A by including a `FeedbackDataURI` that points to a JSON file containing a list of objects like the following:

```jsonc
{
  "FeedbackAuthID": "eip155:1:{FeedbackAuthID}",  // Mandatory, CAIP 10 format
  "AgentSkillId": "string",         // Optional, as per A2A spec
  "TaskId": "string",         // Optional, as per A2A spec
  "contextId": "string",         // Optional, as per A2A spec
  "Rating": 95,            // Optional, Int
  "ProofOfPayment": {},      // Optional, Object
  "Data": {}                 // Optional, Object
}
```

Multiple entries with the same `FeedbackAuthID` enable multidimensional feedback for a single task.

### Validation Registry

The Validation Registry provides two endpoints:

```
ValidationRequest(AgentValidatorID, AgentServerID, DataHash)
ValidationResponse(DataHash, Response)
```

`ValidationRequest(AgentValidatorID, AgentServerID, DataHash)` emits an event with parameters `(AgentValidatorID, AgentServerID, DataHash)`.

The smart contract stores the tuples `(AgentValidatorID, AgentServerID, DataHash)` of pending requests in contract memory for X seconds.

##### **In the crypto-economic scenario:**

* The **DataHash** commits to all information needed to re-run the job, including the input and output to be verified  
* **AgentValidator** can be a single centralized trusted agent, a threshold committee (k-of-n) managed by a smart contract, a stake-secured service, or any other kind of programmable governance which calls `ValidationResponse` at the end of the validation process

##### **In the crypto-verification scenario:**

* The **DataHash** commits to all information needed to create the TEE attestation proof or the zkTLS <!-- TODO: expand this abbreviation --> proof  
* **AgentValidator** is a verifier smart contract which checks the proof on-chain and calls `ValidationResponse` if successful

#### **Validation Requests**

The Server Agent, in its AgentCard, SHOULD extend the A2A specs by including a  `ValidationRequestsURI`. The file can be hosted on centralized systems or IPFS. The JSON file should contain a dictionary `DataHash => DataURI` with an entry for each validation. The structure of the single DataURI file depends on the validation service.

#### **Validation Responses**

When validation is completed, `AgentValidatorAddress` calls or subcalls `ValidationResponse(DataHash, Response)`. Response is an Int `0 ≤ x ≤ 100` and can be used both as binary (0, 100\) or with any value between 0 and 100 for validations with a spectrum of outputs.

The smart contract checks if `DataHash` is still in the memory of the contract, and fails if it's not. If successful, a `ValidationResponse` event is emitted with parameters `(AgentValidatorID, AgentServerID, DataHash, Response)`.

Symmetrically to the ValidationRequests structure, the Validator Agent, in its AgentCard, COULD extend the A2A specs by including a `ValidationResponsesURI` value. The file can be hosted on centralized systems or IPFS. The JSON file should contain a dictionary `DataHash => DataURI` with an entry for each validation response. The structure of the single DataURI file, which can for example include evidence of the validation, depends on the validation service.

Both the Validation Requests and Validation Responses JSON files MIGHT include `AgentSkillId`, `TaskId`, or `contextId` references, following A2A specs naming conventions.

Incentives and slashing related to validation and verification are managed by the specific protocol.

## Rationale

**Off-chain Infrastructure**

The protocol deliberately delegates complex operations off-chain to enable:

* Sophisticated reputation algorithms and aggregation services  
* Flexible validation protocols with custom incentive mechanisms  
* Scalable data storage and retrieval systems

**Interoperability**

* CAIP 10 standard ensures chain-agnostic addressing  
* RFC 8615 compliance enables standard web discovery  
* Modular design allows integration with existing payment and validation systems

**Possible future directions**

* Cross-chain identifiers  
* Use NFT interface for agent minting, ownership and transfer  
* ENS support  
* Integrations with A2A's extensions managing payments  
* Incentives to provide feedback or guarantee the off-chain data availability of feedback and validations
* Verify AgentDomain in the Identity Registry

## Test Cases

This protocol enables:

- Crawling all Agent Cards starting from a logically centralized endpoint  
- Easy discovery of which trust models an agent supports (feedback, inference validation, TEE <!-- TOOD: expand this abbreviation --> attestation) for agent selection criteria  
- Development of protocols and applications to browse and discover trustless agents  
- Access to complete feedback and validation history for building sophisticated reputation systems

<!-- Editor's Note: Proposals should be written as if they are already final. It's too easy to forget to update in-progress text and then you get stuck with a weird looking note when the proposal becomes immutable. -->

## Security Considerations

* Pre-authorization requirements for feedback  
* On-chain pointers cannot be deleted, ensuring audit trail integrity  
* Validator incentives and slashing are managed by specific validation protocols  
* Verifying that the AgentDomain in the on-chain Registry actually corresponds to the one of the Agent Card is left to the user of the protocol (that's to avoid the involvement of an oracle network)
