## Abstract

This ERC proposes a standard for enabling AI-driven automatic transactions on the Ethereum blockchain, where the blockchain serves as a repository of shared **instincts**—common rules and guidelines that direct AI agents in their off-chain computations and actions. Given that AI and machine learning require substantial computational resources and are typically executed off-chain, this standard allows the blockchain to provide a decentralized, immutable framework of instincts that AI agents from different providers can access and follow.

Each instinct is associated with a **temptation value**, a numerical metric (positive for rewards, negative for penalties) that incentivizes AI agents to pursue certain actions. Instincts represent final goals that agents strive to achieve, while **mid-way targets** are intermediate steps generated on-chain to guide agents toward these goals. Both instincts and mid-way targets are evaluated based on their temptation values, enabling AI agents to prioritize actions by weighing potential rewards against associated costs.

AI agents interact with the blockchain by reading instincts and mid-way targets stored in smart contracts. The **path** refers to the sequence of off-chain computations and decisions an agent undertakes to fulfill an instinct. When the trigger conditions for an instinct or mid-way target are met—either through on-chain events or verified off-chain computations—the blockchain automatically executes the associated transactions without requiring the AI agents to manage private keys.

This system addresses key challenges in integrating AI with blockchain technology:

- **Common Rules for AI Agents**: By storing instincts on the blockchain, AI agents from different providers operate under a unified set of rules, promoting interoperability and fairness.
- **Security and Efficiency**: Automatic execution of transactions eliminates the need for AI agents to handle private keys, enhancing security and reducing the potential for human error.
- **Adaptability**: The use of dynamic instincts and mid-way targets allows the system to adapt to changing conditions, ensuring that AI agents can respond effectively to real-world events while operating off-chain.

By providing a decentralized, secure, and adaptive framework of instincts, this ERC enables the creation of a self-regulating, collaborative ecosystem where AI agents can make autonomous decisions guided by shared principles stored on the blockchain.

## Motivation

As the field of artificial intelligence (AI) evolves, autonomous systems increasingly require decentralized, common rules to ensure fairness, security, and cooperation among different agents. This ERC addresses the need for a framework that allows the blockchain to store and enforce **instincts**—guidelines that direct AI agents operating off-chain to achieve specific goals. Given that AI computations demand significant resources and are typically executed off-chain, the blockchain's role is to provide a transparent, tamper-proof structure of shared rules to ensure consistent and secure behavior across diverse agents.

### Key Concepts:

1. **Off-Chain AI Processing**: AI agents handle computation-intensive tasks off-chain, but they rely on **instincts** stored on the blockchain to guide their decisions. The blockchain doesn't handle the heavy computation but rather provides the essential rules and conditions under which AI agents operate.

2. **Instincts as Shared Rules**: Instincts are the core concept, representing predefined or dynamic goals AI agents follow. These instincts ensure interoperability between AI agents from different providers, allowing them to operate under a unified set of rules. Blockchain acts as the central repository of these instincts, offering an immutable, decentralized system for rule enforcement.

3. **Mid-Way Targets and Automatic Execution**: Blockchain generates **mid-way targets**—smaller steps AI agents must achieve to reach their final instincts. These targets help break down complex tasks into manageable actions. When conditions for these targets are met, the blockchain automatically executes the corresponding transactions, ensuring efficiency and transparency without requiring agents to handle private keys.

### Use Cases:

1. **Automated Financial Trading**: In decentralized finance (DeFi), AI agents use blockchain-stored instincts to optimize trading strategies. For example, instincts could instruct an agent to buy assets when their price drops by 5% or sell when prices increase by 10%. Mid-way targets break down these complex strategies into actionable steps, such as executing a buy order when the conditions are met. The blockchain ensures these trades are executed automatically, securely, and consistently across all agents.

2. **Supply Chain Optimization**: AI agents in logistics can rely on instincts stored on the blockchain to manage the flow of goods. For instance, instincts may direct an agent to reduce delivery times, while mid-way targets may specify actions like selecting the fastest route or optimizing shipment schedules. The blockchain guarantees that decisions based on these instincts are transparent and auditable, fostering trust among participants in the supply chain.

3. **Energy Grid Management**: In decentralized energy markets, AI agents could be tasked with minimizing energy costs. The blockchain stores instincts to reduce consumption during peak hours or switch to renewable sources. Mid-way targets guide agents in managing energy use step-by-step, and the blockchain automatically executes energy purchase or sale transactions when the conditions are met.

4. **Maximizing Account Balance**: AI agents could have instincts to maximize an account balance. Blockchain-stored instincts might present options like earning 5 native tokens for completing a simple task or 10 tokens for a more complex task. While earning 10 tokens has a higher temptation value, the agent must consider the costs. The blockchain provides a secure environment for evaluating and executing the most efficient decision.

5. **Gaming and Virtual Environments**: In blockchain-based games, instincts stored on-chain could guide AI agents in completing quests or winning battles. Mid-way targets such as “collect resources” or “defeat enemies” are stored on the blockchain and guide the AI through the game. The system automatically executes in-game actions when conditions are met, enhancing player engagement and transparency.

### Problem Solved:

This ERC addresses the need for decentralized, common rules that guide AI agents in a secure, consistent manner. By offloading computationally intensive tasks off-chain, the blockchain serves as a rule-enforcement mechanism, providing a transparent and immutable system for storing instincts and executing transactions. This framework ensures interoperability among different AI agents while maintaining security and efficiency in a variety of use cases.

## Specification

### Instinct Definition

1. **Instinct Attributes**:
   - `instinctID`: A unique identifier assigned to each instinct upon creation. This ID is used to reference and track the instinct on-chain. Instincts are stored on the blockchain to guide AI agents in their off-chain computations and actions.
   - `temptationValue`: A numerical value representing the temptation level for an instinct. Positive values indicate rewards that attract the AI agent to pursue the instinct, while negative values represent penalties (costs). The temptation value helps the AI agent prioritize between different instincts based on expected rewards and associated costs.
   - `triggerConditions`: Conditions that must be met for the instinct to be triggered. These conditions could involve on-chain data (e.g., block numbers, price feeds) or off-chain data delivered by oracles (e.g., real-world events or external computation results). Once these conditions are satisfied, the instinct is activated, and the next action is taken.
   - `static`: A boolean flag indicating whether the instinct is immutable (static) or modifiable (dynamic). Static instincts remain fixed after creation, while dynamic instincts can evolve based on external inputs or changing system states.
   - `autoExecution`: A boolean flag determining whether the transaction linked to an instinct should automatically execute when the trigger conditions are met. If `true`, the blockchain autonomously executes the transaction without further input from the AI agent, ensuring seamless interaction between the blockchain and off-chain AI processing.

2. **Mid-way Targets**:
   - Mid-way targets are generated by the blockchain to represent intermediate steps AI agents must complete to achieve the final instinct. These smaller, more manageable tasks are essential in guiding AI agents toward the final goal. Mid-way targets also have their own `temptationValue` and `triggerConditions`.
   - Example: To achieve the instinct of acquiring 50 native coins, mid-way targets might include "earn 5 coins" or "earn 10 coins." Each target has its own temptation value and cost associated with it, allowing the AI agent to decide on the most efficient course of action.

3. **Instinct Management**:
   - `createInstinct(instinctID, temptationValue, triggerConditions, static, autoExecution)`: A function allowing the creation of a new instinct on-chain. The instinct is stored on the blockchain and serves as a rule for AI agents to follow in their off-chain computations.
   - `modifyInstinct(instinctID, temptationValue, triggerConditions)`: This function allows for modifying the attributes of an existing instinct, such as adjusting the temptation value or updating the trigger conditions. Dynamic instincts can be updated based on external conditions.
   - `deleteInstinct(instinctID)`: This function deletes an instinct from the system, preventing further interaction with it. Deleting instincts may be useful for completed or expired instincts.

### AI-Agent Interaction

1. **Evaluation and Action**:
   - `evaluateInstincts(agentID, timeFrame)`: AI agents operating off-chain periodically query available instincts from the blockchain and evaluate them based on temptation values, costs, and available resources. Agents compute the best course of action and decide which instinct to pursue.
   - Example: If the agent has two instincts (earn 5 coins vs. earn 10 coins), it evaluates which option provides the best net reward after considering the associated costs (e.g., gas fees, computational effort).
   - `actOnInstinct(instinctID, agentID)`: Once an agent selects the optimal instinct, this function triggers the corresponding action off-chain, and the result is verified on-chain via the smart contract. The agent is rewarded if the conditions are successfully met.

2. **Automatic Execution**:
   - If `autoExecution` is enabled, the system autonomously executes the transaction when the conditions for the instinct or mid-way target are met. This ensures seamless interaction between the blockchain and off-chain AI computations, eliminating the need for agents to manually sign or trigger the transaction.
   - Example: If the instinct is to buy tokens when the price drops below a certain value, the smart contract automatically executes the purchase when the price condition is met, without the need for the agent's direct intervention.

3. **Learning Process**:
   - `labelInstinct(instinctID, cost)`: This function allows the agent to label an instinct based on the cost incurred during its pursuit. The cost is stored for future decision-making, allowing agents to avoid high-cost instincts.
   - Example: If an instinct required excessive gas fees, the agent can label it with a higher cost, which discourages similar actions in the future.
   - `updateStrategy(agentID)`: This function enables AI agents to update their strategies based on past experience, improving efficiency in future interactions. Agents adjust their decision-making process based on learned costs and rewards.

### Dynamic Instincts

1. **Instinct Updates**:
   - Dynamic instincts adapt over time based on changing external conditions or data. This allows instincts to remain relevant in evolving environments (e.g., fluctuating market conditions or changing network traffic).
   - `updateInstinct(instinctID, newTemptationValue)`: This function dynamically updates the temptation value or trigger conditions of an instinct based on predefined rules or real-time data, allowing the blockchain to reflect current conditions.
   - Example: If market volatility increases, the temptation value for trading-related instincts may increase, encouraging AI agents to act.

### Example Walkthrough

**Scenario**: An AI agent wants to maximize its account balance by selecting between two tasks, A and B, as defined by instincts on-chain.

- **Instinct**: The agent's goal is to increase its native token balance.
- **Mid-way Targets**:
  - **Target A**: Perform a staking task to earn 5 native tokens. Temptation value: +5. Cost: -2 (resource cost for staking).
  - **Target B**: Perform a more complex task to earn 10 native tokens. Temptation value: +10. Cost: -7 (more resources required for the task).

- **Evaluation**: The agent evaluates both mid-way targets based on temptation values and costs. Although Target B offers higher rewards, its higher cost leads the agent to select Target A. 
- **Execution**: Once the agent completes Target A's task off-chain, the smart contract verifies the conditions on-chain and automatically transfers 5 native tokens to the agent's account.

## Rationale

The design decisions in this ERC are centered around creating a flexible, adaptive framework that allows AI agents operating off-chain to interact seamlessly with blockchain-stored instincts and rules. The goal is to enable autonomous decision-making while ensuring security, efficiency, and interoperability among diverse AI systems.

1. **Blockchain as a Provider of Common Rules (Instincts)**:
   - **Decision**: Utilize the blockchain to store instincts—shared rules and guidelines that AI agents follow in their off-chain computations and actions.
   - **Rationale**: By centralizing instincts on the blockchain, we ensure that all AI agents, regardless of their origin or provider, operate under a unified set of transparent and immutable rules. This fosters interoperability and trust among agents in decentralized environments.

2. **Temptation Values for Prioritization**:
   - **Decision**: Assign temptation values (positive for rewards, negative for costs) to instincts and mid-way targets to help AI agents prioritize actions.
   - **Rationale**: Temptation values provide a quantitative measure for AI agents to evaluate the potential benefits and costs of pursuing certain instincts. This mirrors human decision-making processes, enabling agents to make informed choices that optimize outcomes based on predefined incentives and disincentives.

3. **Mid-way Targets to Guide Progress**:
   - **Decision**: Introduce mid-way targets as intermediate steps toward achieving final instincts, each with its own temptation value and conditions.
   - **Rationale**: Breaking down complex goals into smaller, manageable tasks allows AI agents to progress incrementally. Mid-way targets facilitate step-by-step guidance, making it easier for agents to navigate toward final instincts while continuously assessing their decisions based on updated information and resources.

4. **Automatic Execution of Transactions**:
   - **Decision**: Enable the blockchain to automatically execute transactions when the trigger conditions for instincts or mid-way targets are met, without requiring AI agents to manage private keys.
   - **Rationale**: Since AI agents operate off-chain and cannot securely handle private keys like humans, automatic execution ensures secure and efficient interaction with the blockchain. It eliminates the need for manual intervention, reduces latency, and enhances security by preventing potential key management vulnerabilities.

5. **Dynamic Instincts for Adaptability**:
   - **Decision**: Allow instincts to be dynamic, updating their temptation values and conditions based on real-time data and external factors.
   - **Rationale**: Dynamic instincts enable the system to remain relevant in changing environments. By adjusting to market conditions, resource availability, or other external inputs, AI agents can adapt their strategies to optimize performance, ensuring that their actions are aligned with current realities.

6. **Learning Process for Continuous Improvement**:
   - **Decision**: Incorporate a learning mechanism where AI agents label instincts with incurred costs and update their decision-making strategies accordingly.
   - **Rationale**: A learning process allows AI agents to evolve over time, refining their strategies based on past experiences. By considering historical costs and outcomes, agents can make more efficient decisions in the future, avoiding high-cost actions with low rewards and focusing on more beneficial pursuits.

7. **Static vs. Dynamic Instincts for Flexibility**:
   - **Decision**: Provide the option to define instincts as static (immutable) or dynamic (modifiable), giving users control over how instincts behave over time.
   - **Rationale**: This flexibility accommodates a wide range of use cases. Static instincts are suitable for stable environments with predictable conditions, while dynamic instincts are ideal for scenarios requiring adaptability. Supporting both types ensures that the system can meet diverse requirements across different domains.

8. **Security Through On-Chain Verification**:
   - **Decision**: Utilize the blockchain's inherent security features to verify the outcomes of off-chain AI computations when agents act on instincts.
   - **Rationale**: By verifying results on-chain, we ensure the integrity and correctness of actions taken by AI agents. This adds a layer of trust and transparency, as all stakeholders can audit transactions and outcomes, reducing the risk of malicious behavior or errors in off-chain computations.

### Summary

The rationale behind these design choices is to create a system where the blockchain serves as a reliable source of common rules and instincts, guiding AI agents operating off-chain. By leveraging temptation values, mid-way targets, automatic execution, and learning processes, we aim to establish an ecosystem where AI agents can make autonomous, optimized decisions that are secure, transparent, and aligned with shared objectives. The distinction between static and dynamic instincts, along with on-chain verification, ensures that the system remains flexible, adaptable, and trustworthy across various applications and environments.


## Test Cases

### 1. Instinct Creation and Modification

- **Test Case 1.1: Creating a New Instinct**

  - **Input**: A user (or system administrator) calls the `createInstinct(instinctID, temptationValue, triggerConditions, static, autoExecution)` function with the following parameters:
    - `instinctID`: `0xINSTINCT1`
    - `temptationValue`: `+10` (reward)
    - `triggerConditions`: External data indicating that the market volatility index exceeds a threshold (e.g., VIX > 30)
    - `static`: `false` (dynamic instinct)
    - `autoExecution`: `true`
  - **Expected Output**: A new instinct is stored on-chain with the specified properties. AI agents operating off-chain can now access this instinct to guide their decision-making. Querying the instinct should return:
    - `instinctID`: `0xINSTINCT1`
    - `temptationValue`: `+10`
    - `triggerConditions`: VIX > 30
    - `static`: `false`
    - `autoExecution`: `true`

- **Test Case 1.2: Modifying an Existing Instinct**

  - **Input**: The system updates the dynamic instinct by calling `modifyInstinct(instinctID, newTemptationValue, newTriggerConditions)` with:
    - `instinctID`: `0xINSTINCT1`
    - `newTemptationValue`: `+15`
    - `newTriggerConditions`: VIX > 25
  - **Expected Output**: The instinct `0xINSTINCT1` is updated on-chain. AI agents are informed of the change and adjust their off-chain computations accordingly. Querying the instinct should return:
    - `temptationValue`: `+15`
    - `triggerConditions`: VIX > 25

- **Test Case 1.3: Deleting an Instinct**

  - **Input**: The system calls `deleteInstinct(instinctID)` with:
    - `instinctID`: `0xINSTINCT1`
  - **Expected Output**: The instinct is removed from the blockchain. AI agents recognize that this instinct is no longer valid and cease actions related to it. Querying for instinct `0xINSTINCT1` should return an error indicating that the instinct does not exist.

### 2. AI-Agent Decision-Making

- **Test Case 2.1: Evaluating Instincts**

  - **Input**: An AI agent operating off-chain retrieves available instincts by reading from the blockchain and calls `evaluateInstincts(agentID, timeFrame)` off-chain with:
    - `agentID`: `0xAGENT1`
    - `timeFrame`: Real-time or specified interval
  - **Expected Output**: The AI agent receives a list of instincts and mid-way targets, along with their temptation values and trigger conditions. For example:
    - Instinct `0xINSTINCT2`: Temptation Value = +20, Trigger Condition: ETH price drops below $2,000
    - Mid-way Target `0xTARGET1`: Temptation Value = +5, Trigger Condition: Complete data analysis task
  - The agent evaluates these instincts and mid-way targets based on their own resources and strategies.

- **Test Case 2.2: Selecting and Acting on an Instinct**

  - **Input**: The AI agent decides to pursue Instinct `0xINSTINCT2` and begins off-chain computations to meet the trigger conditions.
  - **Expected Output**: Once the agent determines that the trigger condition (ETH price < $2,000) is met, it proceeds to execute the necessary off-chain actions (e.g., preparing to purchase ETH). The agent then interacts with the blockchain by calling `actOnInstinct(instinctID, agentID)` to inform the smart contract of the action taken.
  - **Blockchain Reaction**: The smart contract verifies the trigger condition using on-chain data or trusted oracles. If verified, and `autoExecution` is `true`, the blockchain automatically executes the associated transaction (e.g., transferring funds to purchase ETH).

### 3. Automatic Execution

- **Test Case 3.1: Automatic Execution without Agent Intervention**

  - **Input**: An instinct with `autoExecution` enabled is stored on-chain:
    - `instinctID`: `0xINSTINCT3`
    - `temptationValue`: `+25`
    - `triggerConditions`: Renewable energy supply exceeds 80% of grid capacity
    - `autoExecution`: `true`
  - **Expected Output**: When the trigger condition is met (as verified by an oracle providing energy grid data), the smart contract automatically executes the transaction associated with the instinct, such as reallocating energy resources. AI agents are informed of the action through the blockchain and adjust their off-chain computations accordingly.

### 4. Learning and Strategy Update

- **Test Case 4.1: Labeling an Instinct with Cost**

  - **Input**: After pursuing an instinct, the AI agent calculates the actual cost incurred (e.g., high computational resources) and records this off-chain. The agent then calls `labelInstinct(instinctID, cost)` to update the cost associated with the instinct:
    - `instinctID`: `0xINSTINCT2`
    - `cost`: `-10` (representing significant resource usage)
  - **Expected Output**: The cost label is updated on-chain for `0xINSTINCT2`. Other AI agents can access this information if the system is designed to share such data, enhancing collective learning.

- **Test Case 4.2: Updating Agent Strategy**

  - **Input**: The AI agent updates its strategy off-chain by adjusting its decision-making algorithms to account for the high cost associated with `0xINSTINCT2`.
  - **Expected Output**: In future evaluations, the agent deprioritizes instincts with high associated costs, opting for actions that offer a better reward-to-cost ratio.

### 5. Dynamic Instinct Adjustment

- **Test Case 5.1: Instinct Updating Based on External Data**

  - **Input**: A dynamic instinct is set up with:
    - `instinctID`: `0xINSTINCT4`
    - `temptationValue`: Initially `+10`
    - `triggerConditions`: Network congestion level (gas prices)
    - `autoExecution`: `false`
  - **Expected Output**: As network congestion decreases (gas prices drop), the temptation value of the instinct automatically increases. For example, if gas prices fall below 30 Gwei, the temptation value updates to `+20`. AI agents receive this updated information when they next query the blockchain and adjust their off-chain computations accordingly.

### 6. Verification of Off-Chain Computations

- **Test Case 6.1: Verifying Agent Actions On-Chain**

  - **Input**: An AI agent completes a complex computation off-chain related to Instinct `0xINSTINCT5` and submits a proof to the blockchain via `actOnInstinct(instinctID, agentID, proofData)` where:
    - `instinctID`: `0xINSTINCT5`
    - `agentID`: `0xAGENT2`
    - `proofData`: Data verifying the completion of the off-chain task (could be a zero-knowledge proof or other verification method)
  - **Expected Output**: The smart contract validates the proof using on-chain logic or external verifiers. If the proof is valid and trigger conditions are met, the blockchain executes the associated transaction (e.g., rewarding the agent). This ensures the integrity of off-chain computations and builds trust in the system.
t cases demonstrate how AI agents interact with the blockchain to retrieve instincts, execute off-chain computations, and how the blockchain automates transactions and verifies outcomes based on these shared rules.

## Security Considerations

1. **Instinct Integrity**: Ensure that instincts and their attributes are immutable and protected against tampering.
2. **AI-Agent Security**: Implement safeguards to prevent AI agents from being manipulated into making harmful or suboptimal decisions.
3. **Data Privacy**: Ensure that the data used to trigger instincts and guide decision-making is securely handled and protected.
