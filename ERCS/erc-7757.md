## Abstract

This ERC proposes a standard for AI-driven automatic transactions on the Ethereum blockchain. These transactions are triggered by predefined or dynamically created "instincts," each associated with a "temptation value." The temptation value is a numerical metric (positive for rewards, negative for penalties) that incentivizes AI agents to pursue certain actions on the blockchain. Instincts represent final goals that the agents strive to achieve. Along the way, "mid-way targets" are generated—these are intermediate steps that agents must complete to reach the final instinct. Both final and mid-way targets are evaluated based on their temptation values, and AI agents decide which actions to prioritize based on these evaluations.

The AI interacts with the chain through smart contracts that define the conditions for each instinct and mid-way target. The "path" refers to the sequence of actions and decisions an agent must take to fulfill an instinct. When the conditions for a target (whether mid-way or final) are met, the smart contract automatically executes the associated transaction. This system allows the creation of a self-regulating, adaptive blockchain ecosystem, where decisions and transactions are driven by agents' calculated pursuit of rewards or avoidance of penalties.

## Motivation

As AI and blockchain technologies evolve, the need for autonomous systems capable of making complex decisions and executing transactions without direct human intervention becomes more critical. This ERC aims to provide a framework for integrating AI-driven instincts into the blockchain, allowing for more adaptive, efficient, and autonomous transaction mechanisms. The system mimics natural decision-making processes, enabling AI agents to navigate toward predefined goals while responding dynamically to changing environments.

### Use Cases:
1. **Automated Financial Trading**: In decentralized finance (DeFi), AI agents could use instincts to optimize trading strategies. An agent might be driven by a positive instinct to maximize profit from price volatility. Mid-way targets such as "buy at a 5% drop" or "sell at a 10% rise" can guide the agent's actions. When these conditions are met, the transaction executes automatically. This system allows for continuous trading without manual input, responding dynamically to market fluctuations.

2. **Supply Chain Management**: In a blockchain-based supply chain, AI agents can optimize the flow of goods by autonomously managing logistics. For example, an instinct might be to reduce delivery times (positive temptation). Mid-way targets, like selecting the most efficient route or adjusting shipment schedules based on weather or traffic, help guide the agent's decisions. The system would automatically execute necessary transactions when optimal conditions are met, such as placing an order or rerouting shipments, reducing delays and improving efficiency.

3. **Energy Grid Optimization**: In a decentralized energy market, AI agents can manage energy distribution based on supply and demand. An agent might be tasked with minimizing energy costs for a household (positive temptation). Mid-way targets could involve adjusting power consumption during off-peak hours or switching to renewable energy sources when available. If the conditions are met (e.g., low demand, affordable prices), the system would automatically execute transactions to buy energy, optimizing cost and resource use.

4. **Maximizing an Account’s Balance**: Imagine a scenario where an AI agent has the instinct to maximize the owner’s account balance. The smart contract would create mid-way targets, each associated with different reward levels. For example:

   - **Target A**: Perform a specific task and earn 5 native coins.
   - **Target B**: Perform a more complex task and earn 10 native coins.
While the temptation value of earning 10 coins (Target B) is higher than earning 5 coins (Target A), the agent must also evaluate the cost (negative temptation) associated with each task. If performing Target B requires significant resources or time, the agent might decide that Target A, with lower rewards but lower costs, is a better choice. The system will automatically execute the transaction for whichever target the agent selects, balancing temptation and cost to achieve the optimal outcome.

5. **Gaming and Virtual Worlds**: In blockchain-based games or virtual environments, AI agents can autonomously make decisions for players or NPCs. An instinct might be to win a battle or complete a quest (positive temptation). Mid-way targets such as "collect resources" or "defeat enemy NPCs" help guide the agent toward the final instinct. Once the agent fulfills certain conditions (e.g., collecting all required resources), the system automatically triggers in-game transactions or actions, creating a more dynamic and immersive experience.

### Problem Solved:
This standard solves the challenge of manually executing repetitive or complex decisions in decentralized systems, allowing AI agents to operate autonomously based on predefined rules. It reduces human intervention, optimizes decision-making, and enhances the efficiency of blockchain transactions across various domains, from finance to supply chains, energy management, and virtual environments.

## Specification

### Instinct Definition

1. **Instinct Attributes**:
   - `instinctID`: Unique identifier for the instinct.
   - `temptationValue`: Numerical value representing the instinct's temptation level (positive for rewards, negative for penalties).
   - `triggerConditions`: Conditions under which the instinct is activated.
   - `static`: Boolean indicating whether the instinct is static or dynamic.
   - `autoExecution`: Boolean indicating whether the transaction should be automatically executed when the conditions are met.

2. **Mid-way Targets**:
   - Mid-way targets are generated dynamically as intermediate steps toward achieving the final instinct.
   - Each mid-way target has its own `temptationValue` and `triggerConditions`.
   - These targets guide the AI agent through a series of decisions and actions leading to the final instinct.

3. **Instinct Management**:
   - `createInstinct(instinctID, temptationValue, triggerConditions, static)`: Creates a new instinct.
   - `modifyInstinct(instinctID, temptationValue, triggerConditions)`: Modifies an existing instinct.
   - `deleteInstinct(instinctID)`: Deletes an instinct.

### AI-Agent Interaction

1. **Evaluation and Action**:
   - `evaluateInstincts(agentID, timeFrame)`: Evaluates all available instincts within a given time frame and returns the optimal action.
   - `actOnInstinct(instinctID, agentID)`: Executes the action associated with a selected instinct.

2. **Automatic Execution**:
   - If `autoExecution` is enabled and the conditions for an instinct or mid-way target are met, the transaction is executed automatically without further input from the agent.

3. **Learning Process**:
   - `labelInstinct(instinctID, cost)`: Labels the cost of pursuing a particular instinct to inform future decision-making.
   - `updateStrategy(agentID)`: Updates the agent's strategy based on past outcomes and cost analyses.

### Dynamic Instincts

1. **Instinct Updates**:
   - `updateInstinct(instinctID, newTemptationValue)`: Updates the temptation value or conditions of a dynamic instinct based on real-time data or external conditions.

## Rationale

By incorporating temptation values and learning processes, the system can dynamically adapt to changing environments, offering a more efficient and self-regulating ecosystem.

## Test Cases

1. **Instinct Creation and Modification**: Test the creation, modification, and deletion of instincts.
2. **AI-Agent Decision-Making**: Test the evaluation and action process for AI agents based on available instincts.
3. **Automatic Execution**: Test the automatic execution of transactions when conditions for an instinct or mid-way target are met.
4. **Learning and Strategy Update**: Test the learning process and strategy updates based on labeled costs and past actions.
5. **Dynamic Instinct Adjustment**: Test the updating mechanism for dynamic instincts based on external data or real-time conditions.

## Security Considerations

1. **Instinct Integrity**: Ensure that instincts and their attributes are immutable and protected against tampering.
2. **AI-Agent Security**: Implement safeguards to prevent AI agents from being manipulated into making harmful or suboptimal decisions.
3. **Data Privacy**: Ensure that the data used to trigger instincts and guide decision-making is securely handled and protected.
