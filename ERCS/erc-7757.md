## Abstract

This ERC proposes a standard for AI-driven automatic transactions on the Ethereum blockchain. These transactions are triggered by predefined or dynamically created "instincts," each associated with a "temptation value." The temptation value is a numerical metric (positive for rewards, negative for penalties) that incentivizes AI agents to pursue certain actions on the blockchain. Instincts represent final goals that the agents strive to achieve. Along the way, "mid-way targets" are generated—these are intermediate steps that agents must complete to reach the final instinct. Both final and mid-way targets are evaluated based on their temptation values, and AI agents decide which actions to prioritize based on these evaluations.

The AI interacts with the chain through smart contracts that define the conditions for each instinct and mid-way target. The "path" refers to the sequence of actions and decisions an agent must take to fulfill an instinct. When the conditions for a target (whether mid-way or final) are met, the smart contract automatically executes the associated transaction. This system allows the creation of a self-regulating, adaptive blockchain ecosystem, where decisions and transactions are driven by agents' calculated pursuit of rewards or avoidance of penalties.

## Motivation

As AI and blockchain technologies evolve, the need for autonomous systems capable of making complex decisions and executing transactions without direct human intervention becomes more critical. This ERC aims to provide a framework for integrating AI-driven instincts into the blockchain, allowing for more adaptive, efficient, and autonomous transaction mechanisms. The system mimics natural decision-making processes, enabling AI agents to navigate toward predefined goals while responding dynamically to changing environments.

### Use Cases:
1. **Automated Financial Trading**: In decentralized finance (DeFi), AI agents could use instincts to optimize trading strategies. An agent might be driven by a positive instinct to maximize profit from price volatility. Mid-way targets such as "buy at a 5% drop" or "sell at a 10% rise" can guide the agent's actions. When these conditions are met, the transaction executes automatically. This system allows for continuous trading without manual input, responding dynamically to market fluctuations.

2. **Supply Chain Management**: In a blockchain-based supply chain, AI agents can optimize the flow of goods by autonomously managing logistics. For example, an instinct might be to reduce delivery times (positive temptation). Mid-way targets, like selecting the most efficient route or adjusting shipment schedules based on weather or traffic, help guide the agent's decisions. The system would automatically execute necessary transactions when optimal conditions are met, such as placing an order or rerouting shipments, reducing delays and improving efficiency.

3. **Energy Grid Optimization**: In a decentralized energy market, AI agents can manage energy distribution based on supply and demand. An agent might be tasked with minimizing energy costs for a household (positive temptation). Mid-way targets could involve adjusting power consumption during off-peak hours or switching to renewable energy sources when available. If the conditions are met (e.g., low demand, affordable prices), the system would automatically execute transactions to buy energy, optimizing cost and resource use.

4. **Maximizing an Account's Balance**: Imagine a scenario where an AI agent has the instinct to maximize the owner's account balance. The smart contract would create mid-way targets, each associated with different reward levels. For example:

   - **Target A**: Perform a specific task and earn 5 native coins.
   - **Target B**: Perform a more complex task and earn 10 native coins.
While the temptation value of earning 10 coins (Target B) is higher than earning 5 coins (Target A), the agent must also evaluate the cost (negative temptation) associated with each task. If performing Target B requires significant resources or time, the agent might decide that Target A, with lower rewards but lower costs, is a better choice. The system will automatically execute the transaction for whichever target the agent selects, balancing temptation and cost to achieve the optimal outcome.

5. **Gaming and Virtual Worlds**: In blockchain-based games or virtual environments, AI agents can autonomously make decisions for players or NPCs. An instinct might be to win a battle or complete a quest (positive temptation). Mid-way targets such as "collect resources" or "defeat enemy NPCs" help guide the agent toward the final instinct. Once the agent fulfills certain conditions (e.g., collecting all required resources), the system automatically triggers in-game transactions or actions, creating a more dynamic and immersive experience.

### Problem Solved:
This standard solves the challenge of manually executing repetitive or complex decisions in decentralized systems, allowing AI agents to operate autonomously based on predefined rules. It reduces human intervention, optimizes decision-making, and enhances the efficiency of blockchain transactions across various domains, from finance to supply chains, energy management, and virtual environments.

## Specification

### **Instinct Definition**

1. **Instinct Attributes**:
   - `instinctID`: A unique identifier (e.g., a hash) assigned to each instinct upon creation. This ID is used to reference and track the instinct on-chain.
   - `temptationValue`: A numerical value representing the instinct's temptation level. This value is positive for rewards (incentives to pursue the instinct) or negative for penalties (disincentives to avoid certain outcomes). The temptation value is calculated based on predefined logic or dynamically adjusted based on external factors.
   - `triggerConditions`: A set of conditions that must be met for the instinct to be activated. These conditions could be based on factors like time (e.g., block number), external data (e.g., price feeds), or agent behavior (e.g., agent performs a specific action). Conditions are defined in the smart contract using an event-based system that monitors on-chain or off-chain data.
   - `static`: A boolean flag that determines whether the instinct is immutable (static) or can be modified (dynamic). If static, the instinct's properties remain unchanged after creation.
   - `autoExecution`: A boolean flag indicating whether the transaction should be automatically executed when the instinct's trigger conditions are met. If `true`, the smart contract autonomously triggers the execution of the transaction without requiring further input from the agent.

2. **Mid-way Targets**:
   - Mid-way targets are dynamically generated goals that represent intermediate steps toward achieving the final instinct. These targets allow for progressive actions, offering smaller rewards or penalties as agents move toward the final instinct.
   - Each mid-way target has its own `temptationValue` and `triggerConditions`, functioning similarly to instincts. Mid-way targets are typically simpler actions with lower temptation values but are essential in guiding agents toward the final instinct.
   - Example: To reach the final instinct of acquiring 50 native coins, mid-way targets might include "acquire 5 coins" or "acquire 10 coins," with temptation values and conditions based on actions that the AI agent can perform (e.g., staking, trading, or other on-chain activities).
   - The system tracks the completion of mid-way targets, and once all targets are completed (or a threshold is reached), the agent can proceed toward the final instinct.

3. **Instinct Management**:
   - `createInstinct(instinctID, temptationValue, triggerConditions, static, autoExecution)`: This function allows users or agents to create a new instinct. The instinct is stored in the smart contract, and its properties, such as temptation value, conditions, and flags, are defined at the time of creation.
   - `modifyInstinct(instinctID, temptationValue, triggerConditions)`: If the instinct is dynamic, this function allows for modifying its properties, such as adjusting the temptation value or updating the conditions. Static instincts cannot be modified.
   - `deleteInstinct(instinctID)`: This function allows for the deletion of an instinct from the contract, preventing further interactions with it. This could be useful for expired or completed instincts.

### **AI-Agent Interaction**

1. **Evaluation and Action**:
   - `evaluateInstincts(agentID, timeFrame)`: This function evaluates all available instincts (and their mid-way targets) for a given agent within a specific time frame (e.g., a block range). The agent calculates the optimal action based on the temptation values, costs, and available conditions. This process could involve machine learning algorithms that weigh past actions' costs versus rewards.
   - Example: If the agent has access to two mid-way targets—one offering 5 coins and the other offering 10 coins—it evaluates the cost of pursuing each based on available resources (gas, time, etc.) and selects the optimal target.
   - `actOnInstinct(instinctID, agentID)`: Once the agent determines the best instinct to pursue, this function initiates the action. The smart contract verifies the conditions and, if met, executes the associated transaction.

2. **Automatic Execution**:
   - When `autoExecution` is enabled, the system autonomously executes the transaction once the trigger conditions for the instinct or mid-way target are met. This is monitored through event listeners in the smart contract, which can react to on-chain events or external data sources.
   - Example: If the instinct is to purchase a token when the price drops below a certain value, the contract monitors the price feed. When the condition is met, the transaction is triggered without agent intervention.

3. **Learning Process**:
   - `labelInstinct(instinctID, cost)`: This function allows the agent to label an instinct based on the cost (negative temptation) it incurs while pursuing it. The agent stores this cost information for future decision-making.
   - Example: If pursuing a certain instinct required high gas fees or took more time than expected, the agent can label it with a higher cost, discouraging the same action in similar situations.
   - `updateStrategy(agentID)`: Based on labeled instincts, this function updates the agent's decision-making algorithm, adjusting future actions to favor lower-cost or higher-reward paths.

### **Dynamic Instincts**

1. **Instinct Updates**:
   - Dynamic instincts can be updated over time based on external conditions or changing system states. This allows instincts to remain relevant as environments change (e.g., market conditions, network congestion).
   - `updateInstinct(instinctID, newTemptationValue)`: The temptation value can be adjusted based on predefined rules or real-time data. For example, if market volatility increases, the temptation value for trading-related instincts could rise, incentivizing agents to act.
   - Conditions for dynamic instincts are monitored in real time, and when external data (e.g., oracle data, off-chain events) changes, the conditions and temptation values are updated accordingly.

### Example Walkthrough (More Detailed)

**Scenario**: An AI agent wants to maximize its account balance by selecting between two tasks, A and B.

- **Instinct**: The agent's instinct is to increase its native token balance.
- **Mid-way Targets**:
  - **Target A**: Complete a staking task to earn 5 native tokens. Temptation value: +5. Cost: -2 (resource cost for staking).
  - **Target B**: Complete a more complex task that earns 10 native tokens. Temptation value: +10. Cost: -7 (more resources required for the task).

- **Evaluation**: The agent evaluates both targets based on temptation values and costs. Although Target B offers higher rewards, the higher cost makes Target A a more efficient option. The agent chooses Target A and acts accordingly.

- **Execution**: Once the agent completes Target A's task (staking), the contract verifies the condition and automatically transfers 5 native tokens to the agent's account.


## Rationale

The key design decisions made in this ERC are driven by the need to create a flexible, adaptive, and autonomous transaction system that balances incentives with costs.

1. **Temptation Values**: 
   - The decision to use **temptation values** (positive for rewards and negative for costs) allows AI agents to evaluate and prioritize actions. We introduced temptation values as a way to quantify the benefits and drawbacks of pursuing different actions. This decision was made to enable agents to make informed choices based on not just the potential reward but also the associated costs, such as gas fees or computational resources.
   - **Rationale**: By using temptation values, agents can weigh the pros and cons of each action in a decentralized environment. This mirrors real-world decision-making where both reward and cost are considered before committing to an action.

2. **Mid-way Targets**: 
   - **Mid-way targets** were introduced to break down complex actions into smaller, manageable steps, each with its own temptation value. These targets guide AI agents toward the final instinct, allowing for more granular control over the decision-making process. 
   - **Rationale**: Introducing mid-way targets provides flexibility and allows agents to make incremental progress toward larger goals. It also helps distribute effort over time, rather than relying on a single, high-cost action.

3. **Automatic Execution**:
   - The system enables **automatic execution** of transactions when certain conditions are met. This feature is included to reduce manual intervention, enabling agents to act quickly and efficiently in response to dynamic environments.
   - **Rationale**: Automatic execution ensures that once conditions for an instinct or mid-way target are met, the transaction can occur without delay, which is critical for time-sensitive actions like financial trades or energy distribution.

4. **Dynamic Instincts**:
   - **Dynamic instincts** are designed to adapt to changing external conditions, such as market prices or environmental data. This allows the system to remain relevant and responsive, with instincts and mid-way targets adjusting in real time based on external inputs.
   - **Rationale**: Dynamic instincts provide adaptability, which is necessary in volatile environments like financial markets or decentralized energy grids. By allowing instincts to change, the system can optimize agent behavior based on real-world events.

5. **Learning Process**:
   - The inclusion of a **learning process** for AI agents allows them to label previous instincts based on their costs and update their strategies accordingly. This feature ensures that agents become more efficient over time by avoiding high-cost actions that offer little reward.
   - **Rationale**: Learning processes enable agents to evolve and optimize their decision-making strategies. This design choice was made to create a self-improving system, where agents can learn from past actions and adjust their behavior to maximize rewards while minimizing costs.

6. **Static vs. Dynamic Instincts**:
   - The ability to mark instincts as **static** or **dynamic** was introduced to give users control over whether an instinct’s properties remain fixed or adjust based on external factors.
   - **Rationale**: This distinction allows for flexibility. Static instincts are useful for fixed, predictable actions, while dynamic instincts are better suited for environments that require real-time adaptation. The system supports both options to cater to various use cases.


## Test Cases

### **1. Instinct Creation and Modification**

- **Test Case 1.1: Creating a New Instinct**
  - **Input**: Call the `createInstinct(instinctID, temptationValue, triggerConditions, static, autoExecution)` function with the following parameters:
    - `instinctID`: `0x123`
    - `temptationValue`: `+10`
    - `triggerConditions`: Block number greater than 1000
    - `static`: `true`
    - `autoExecution`: `false`
  - **Expected Output**: A new instinct is created on-chain with the specified properties. Querying the instinct should return:
    - `instinctID`: `0x123`
    - `temptationValue`: `+10`
    - `triggerConditions`: Block number > 1000
    - `static`: `true`
    - `autoExecution`: `false`

- **Test Case 1.2: Modifying an Existing Instinct**
  - **Input**: Call the `modifyInstinct(instinctID, newTemptationValue, newTriggerConditions)` function to modify the existing instinct:
    - `instinctID`: `0x123`
    - `newTemptationValue`: `+15`
    - `newTriggerConditions`: Block number greater than 500
  - **Expected Output**: The instinct with `instinctID: 0x123` is updated. Querying the instinct should return:
    - `temptationValue`: `+15`
    - `triggerConditions`: Block number > 500

- **Test Case 1.3: Deleting an Instinct**
  - **Input**: Call the `deleteInstinct(instinctID)` function with:
    - `instinctID`: `0x123`
  - **Expected Output**: The instinct is deleted from the system. Querying for instinct `0x123` should return an error indicating that the instinct does not exist.

### **2. AI-Agent Decision-Making**

- **Test Case 2.1: Evaluating Instincts**
  - **Input**: AI agent calls `evaluateInstincts(agentID, timeFrame)` where:
    - `agentID`: `0xABC`
    - `timeFrame`: Last 100 blocks
  - **Expected Output**: The AI agent receives a list of available instincts, sorted by temptation value and cost. Example output:
    - Instinct `0x123`: Temptation Value = +15, Cost = -5 (net temptation: +10)
    - Instinct `0x456`: Temptation Value = +5, Cost = -1 (net temptation: +4)

- **Test Case 2.2: Acting on an Instinct**
  - **Input**: AI agent selects instinct `0x123` (highest net temptation) and calls `actOnInstinct(instinctID, agentID)` where:
    - `instinctID`: `0x123`
    - `agentID`: `0xABC`
  - **Expected Output**: The system verifies the conditions for instinct `0x123`. If the block number is greater than 500, the agent receives +15 tokens as a reward, and the state is updated to reflect this balance change. Querying the agent's balance should return:
    - Initial Balance: 0 tokens
    - Final Balance: +15 tokens

### **3. Automatic Execution**

- **Test Case 3.1: Automatic Execution of an Instinct**
  - **Input**: Create an instinct with auto-execution enabled:
    - `instinctID`: `0x789`
    - `temptationValue`: `+20`
    - `triggerConditions`: External price data (e.g., ETH price drops below $2000)
    - `autoExecution`: `true`
  - **Expected Output**: When the external condition (ETH price < $2000) is met, the smart contract automatically executes the transaction without agent intervention. The agent receives +20 tokens. Querying the agent’s balance should return:
    - Initial Balance: 15 tokens (from previous test case)
    - Final Balance: 35 tokens

### **4. Learning and Strategy Update**

- **Test Case 4.1: Labeling an Instinct with Cost**
  - **Input**: After acting on instinct `0x123`, the agent calls `labelInstinct(instinctID, cost)` where:
    - `instinctID`: `0x123`
    - `cost`: `-5` (high gas fees)
  - **Expected Output**: The instinct is labeled with the cost. Querying the instinct's label should return:
    - `cost`: `-5`
    - `temptationValue`: `+15`
    - Net Temptation: `+10`

- **Test Case 4.2: Strategy Update**
  - **Input**: After labeling, the agent calls `updateStrategy(agentID)` to update its decision-making based on the labeled costs.
  - **Expected Output**: The agent adjusts its future actions to prioritize instincts with higher net temptation values (taking costs into account). Future evaluation should favor lower-cost actions.

### **5. Dynamic Instinct Adjustment**

- **Test Case 5.1: Updating Dynamic Instinct Based on Real-Time Data**
  - **Input**: A dynamic instinct is created with the following parameters:
    - `instinctID`: `0x999`
    - `temptationValue`: Initially set to +10
    - `triggerConditions`: Based on gas fees (lower gas fees increase temptation value)
    - `autoExecution`: `false`
  - **Expected Output**: When gas fees drop below 50 Gwei, the temptation value automatically increases to +20. Querying the instinct should return:
    - `temptationValue`: `+20`
    - `triggerConditions`: Gas fee < 50 Gwei

## Security Considerations

1. **Instinct Integrity**: Ensure that instincts and their attributes are immutable and protected against tampering.
2. **AI-Agent Security**: Implement safeguards to prevent AI agents from being manipulated into making harmful or suboptimal decisions.
3. **Data Privacy**: Ensure that the data used to trigger instincts and guide decision-making is securely handled and protected.
