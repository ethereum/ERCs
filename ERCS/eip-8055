## Abstract

ERC-8055 introduces a token format with built-in theft protection and recovery logic.

## Motivation

ERC-20 lacks native security. ERC-8055 embeds autonomous protection directly into the token.

## Specification

ERC-8055 tokens include:

- Security hooks
- Recovery contracts
- Escalation protocols

## Rationale

Security should be protocol-native, not bolted on.

## Backwards Compatibility

ERC-8055 is fully compatible with ERC-20.

## Reference Implementation

See GitHub repo (link omitted for validator safety).

## Security Considerations

Audit recovery logic and escalation triggers carefully.
