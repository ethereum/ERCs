## Abstract

Principal tokens represent ownership of an underlying [EIP-20](./eip-20.md) token at a future timestamp.

This specification is an extension on the [EIP-20](./eip-20.md) token that provides basic functionality for depositing
and withdrawing tokens and reading balances and the [EIP-2612](./eip-2612.md) specification that provides
[EIP-712](./eip-712.md) signature based approvals.

## Motivation

Principal tokens lack standardization which has led to a difficult to navigate development space and diverse implementation
schemes.

The primary examples include yield tokenization platforms which strip future yield leaving a principal
token behind, as well as fixed-rate money-markets which utilize principal tokens as a medium
to lend/borrow.

This inconsistency in implementation makes integration difficult at the application layer as well as
wallet layer which are key catalysts for the space's growth.
Developers are currently expected to implement individual adapters for each principal token, as well as adapters for
their pool contracts, and many times adapters for their custodial contracts as well, wasting significant developer resources.

## Specification

All Principal Tokens (PTs) MUST implement [EIP-20](./eip-20.md) to represent ownership of future underlying redemption.
If a PT is to be non-transferrable, it MAY revert on calls to `transfer` or `transferFrom`.
The [EIP-20](./eip-20.md) operations `balanceOf`, `transfer`, `totalSupply`, etc. operate on the Principal Token balance.

All Principal Tokens MUST implement [EIP-20](./eip-20.md)'s optional metadata extensions.
The `name` and `symbol` functions SHOULD reflect the underlying token's `name` and `symbol` in some way, as well as the origination protocol, and in the case of yield tokenization protocols, the origination money-market.

All Principal Tokens MAY implement [EIP-2612](./eip-2612.md) to improve the UX of approving PTs on various integrations.

### Definitions:

- underlying: The token that Principal Tokens are redeemable for at maturity.
  Has units defined by the corresponding [EIP-20](./eip-20.md) contract.
- maturity: The timestamp (unix) at which a Principal Token matures. Principal Tokens become redeemable for underlying at or after this timestamp.
- fee: An amount of underlying or Principal Token charged to the user by the Principal Token. Fees can exist on redemption or post-maturity yield.
- slippage: Any difference between advertised redemption value and economic realities of PT redemption, which is not accounted by fees.

### Methods

#### `underlying`

The address of the underlying token used by the Principal Token for accounting, and redeeming.

MUST be an EIP-20 token contract.

MUST _NOT_ revert.

```yaml
- name: underlying
  type: function
  stateMutability: view

  inputs: []

  outputs:
    - name: underlyingAddress
      type: address
```

#### `maturity`

The unix timestamp (uint256) at or after which Principal Tokens can be redeemed for their underlying deposit.

MUST _NOT_ revert.

```yaml
- name: maturity
  type: function
  stateMutability: view

  inputs: []

  outputs:
    - name: timestamp
      type: uint256
```

#### `convertToUnderlying`

The amount of underlying that would be exchanged for the amount of PTs provided, in an ideal scenario where all the conditions are met.

Before maturity, the amount of underlying returned is as if the PTs would be at maturity.

MUST NOT be inclusive of any fees that are charged against redemptions.

MUST NOT show any variations depending on the caller.

MUST NOT reflect slippage or other on-chain conditions, when performing the actual redemption.

MUST NOT revert unless due to integer overflow caused by an unreasonably large input.

MUST round down towards 0.

This calculation MAY NOT reflect the "per-user" price-per-principal-token, and instead should reflect the "average-user's" price-per-principal-token, meaning what the average user should expect to see when exchanging to and from.

```yaml
- name: convertToUnderlying
  type: function
  stateMutability: view

  inputs:
    - name: principalAmount
      type: uint256

  outputs:
    - name: underlyingAmount
      type: uint256
```

#### `convertToPrincipal`

The amount of principal tokens that the principal token contract would request for redemption in order to provide the amount of underlying specified, in an ideal scenario where all the conditions are met.

MUST NOT be inclusive of any fees.

MUST NOT show any variations depending on the caller.

MUST NOT reflect slippage or other on-chain conditions, when performing the actual exchange.

MUST NOT revert unless due to integer overflow caused by an unreasonably large input.

MUST round down towards 0.

This calculation MAY NOT reflect the "per-user" price-per-principal-token, and instead should reflect the "average-user's" price-per-principal-token, meaning what the average user should expect to see when redeeming.

```yaml
- name: convertToPrincipal
  type: function
  stateMutability: view

  inputs:
    - name: underlyingAmount
      type: uint256

  outputs:
    - name: principalAmount
      type: uint256
```

#### `maxRedeem`

Maximum amount of principal tokens that can be redeemed from the `holder` balance, through a `redeem` call.

MUST return the maximum amount of principal tokens that could be transferred from `holder` through `redeem` and not cause a revert, which MUST NOT be higher than the actual maximum that would be accepted (it should underestimate if necessary).

MUST factor in both global and user-specific limits, like if redemption is entirely disabled (even temporarily) it MUST return 0.

MUST NOT revert.

```yaml
- name: maxRedeem
  type: function
  stateMutability: view

  inputs:
    - name: holder
      type: address

  outputs:
    - name: maxPrincipalAmount
      type: uint256
```

#### `previewRedeem`

Allows an on-chain or off-chain user to simulate the effects of their redeemption at the current block, given current on-chain conditions.

MUST return as close to and no more than the exact amount of underliyng that would be obtained in a `redeem` call in the same transaction. I.e. `redeem` should return the same or more `underlyingAmount` as `previewRedeem` if called in the same transaction.

MUST NOT account for redemption limits like those returned from maxRedeem and should always act as though the redemption would be accepted, regardless if the user has enough principal tokens, etc.

MUST be inclusive of redemption fees. Integrators should be aware of the existence of redemption fees.

MUST NOT revert due to principal token contract specific user/global limits. MAY revert due to other conditions that would also cause `redeem` to revert.

Note that any unfavorable discrepancy between `convertToUnderlying` and `previewRedeem` SHOULD be considered slippage in price-per-principal-token or some other type of condition.

```yaml
- name: previewRedeem
  type: function
  stateMutability: view

  inputs:
    - name: principalAmount
      type: uint256

  outputs:
    - name: underlyingAmount
      type: uint256
```

#### `redeem`

At or after maturity, burns exactly `principalAmount` of Principal Tokens from `from` and sends `underlyingAmount` of underlying tokens to `to`.

Interfaces and other contracts MUST NOT expect fund custody to be present. While custodial redemption of Principal Tokens through the Principal Token contract is extremely useful for integrators, some protocols may find giving the Principal Token itself custody breaks their backwards compatibility.

MUST emit the `Redeem` event.

MUST support a redeem flow where the Principal Tokens are burned from `holder` directly where `holder` is `msg.sender` or `msg.sender` has EIP-20 approval over the principal tokens of `holder`.
MAY support an additional flow in which the principal tokens are transferred to the Principal Token contract before the `redeem` execution, and are accounted for during `redeem`.

MUST revert if all of `principalAmount` cannot be redeemed (due to withdrawal limit being reached, slippage, the holder not having enough Principal Tokens, etc).

Note that some implementations will require pre-requesting to the Principal Token before a withdrawal may be performed. Those methods should be performed separately.

```yaml
- name: redeem
  type: function
  stateMutability: nonpayable

  inputs:
    - name: principalAmount
      type: uint256
    - name: to
      type: address
    - name: from
      type: address

  outputs:
    - name: underlyingAmount
      type: uint256
```

#### `maxWithdraw`

Maximum amount of the underlying asset that can be redeemed from the `holder` principal token balance, through a `withdraw` call.

MUST return the maximum amount of underlying tokens that could be redeemed from `holder` through `withdraw` and not cause a revert, which MUST NOT be higher than the actual maximum that would be accepted (it should underestimate if necessary).

MUST factor in both global and user-specific limits, like if withdrawals are entirely disabled (even temporarily) it MUST return 0.

MUST NOT revert.

```yaml
- name: maxWithdraw
  type: function
  stateMutability: view

  inputs:
    - name: holder
      type: address

  outputs:
    - name: maxUnderlyingAmount
      type: uint256
```

#### `previewWithdraw`

Allows an on-chain or off-chain user to simulate the effects of their withdrawal at the current block, given current on-chain conditions.

MUST return as close to and no fewer than the exact amount of principal tokens that would be burned in a `withdraw` call in the same transaction. I.e. `withdraw` should return the same or fewer `principalAmount` as `previewWithdraw` if called in the same transaction.

MUST NOT account for withdrawal limits like those returned from maxWithdraw and should always act as though the withdrawal would be accepted, regardless if the user has enough principal tokens, etc.

MUST be inclusive of withdrawal fees. Integrators should be aware of the existence of withdrawal fees.

MUST NOT revert due to principal token contract specific user/global limits. MAY revert due to other conditions that would also cause `withdraw` to revert.

Note that any unfavorable discrepancy between `convertToPrincipal` and `previewWithdraw` SHOULD be considered slippage in price-per-principal-token or some other type of condition.

```yaml
- name: previewWithdraw
  type: function
  stateMutability: view

  inputs:
    - name: underlyingAmount
      type: uint256

  outputs:
    - name: principalAmount
      type: uint256
```

#### `withdraw`

Burns `principalAmount` from `holder` and sends exactly `underlyingAmount` of underlying tokens to `receiver`.

MUST emit the `Redeem` event.

MUST support a withdraw flow where the principal tokens are burned from `holder` directly where `holder` is `msg.sender` or `msg.sender` has [EIP-20](./eip-20.md) approval over the principal tokens of `holder`.
 MAY support an additional flow in which the principal tokens are transferred to the principal token contract before the `withdraw` execution, and are accounted for during `withdraw`.

MUST revert if all of `underlyingAmount` cannot be withdrawn (due to withdrawal limit being reached, slippage, the holder not having enough principal tokens, etc).

Note that some implementations will require pre-requesting to the principal token contract before a withdrawal may be performed. Those methods should be performed separately.

```yaml
- name: withdraw
  type: function
  stateMutability: nonpayable

  inputs:
    - name: underlyingAmount
      type: uint256
    - name: receiver
      type: address
    - name: holder
      type: address

  outputs:
    - name: principalAmount
      type: uint256
```

### Events

#### Redeem

`from` has exchanged `principalAmount` of Principal Tokens for `underlyingAmount` of underlying, and transferred that underlying to `to`.

MUST be emitted when Principal Tokens are burnt and underlying is withdrawn from the contract in the `EIP5095.redeem` method.

```yaml
- name: Redeem
  type: event

  inputs:
    - name: from
      indexed: true
      type: address
    - name: to
      indexed: true
      type: address
    - name: amount
      indexed: false
      type: uint256
```

## Rationale

The Principal Token interface is designed to be optimized for integrators with a core minimal interface alongside optional interfaces to enable backwards compatibility. Details such as accounting and management of underlying are intentionally not specified, as Principal Tokens are expected to be treated as black boxes on-chain and inspected off-chain before use.

[EIP-20](./eip-20.md) is enforced as implementation details such as token approval and balance calculation directly carry over. This standardization makes Principal Tokens immediately compatible with all [EIP-20](./eip-20.md) use cases in addition to EIP-5095.

All principal tokens are redeemable upon maturity, with the only variance being whether further yield is generated post-maturity. Given the ubiquity of redemption, the presence of `redeem` allows integrators to purchase Principal Tokens on an open market, and them later redeem them for a fixed-yield solely knowing the address of the Principal Token itself.

This EIP draws heavily on the design of [EIP-4626](./eip-4626.md) because technically Principal Tokens could be described as a subset of Yield Bearing Vaults, extended with a `maturity` variable and restrictions on the implementation. However, extending [EIP-4626](./eip-4626.md) would force PT implementations to include methods (namely, `mint` and `deposit`) that are not necessary to the business case that PTs solve. It can also be argued that partial redemptions (implemented via `withdraw`) are rare for PTs.

PTs mature at a precise second, but given the reactive nature of smart contracts, there can't be an event marking maturity, because there is no guarantee of any activity at or after maturity. Emitting an event to notify of maturity in the first transaction after maturity would be imprecise and expensive. Instead, integrators are recommended to either use the first `Redeem` event, or to track themselves when each PT is expected to have matured.

## Backwards Compatibility

This EIP is fully backward compatible with the [EIP-20](./eip-20.md) specification and has no known compatibility issues with other standards.
For production implementations of Principal Tokens which do not use EIP-5095, wrapper adapters can be developed and used, or wrapped tokens can be implemented.

## Security Considerations

Fully permissionless use cases could fall prey to malicious implementations which only conform to the interface in this EIP but not the specification, failing to implement proper custodial functionality but offering the ability to purchase Principal Tokens through secondary markets.

It is recommended that all integrators review each implementation for potential ways of losing user deposits before integrating.

The `convertToUnderlying` method is an estimate useful for display purposes,
and do _not_ have to confer the _exact_ amount of underlying assets their context suggests.

As is common across many standards, it is strongly recommended to mirror the underlying token's `decimals` if at all possible, to eliminate possible sources of confusion and simplify integration across front-ends and for other off-chain users.
