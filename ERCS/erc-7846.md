## Abstract

This ERC introduces a new wallet connection RPC method focused on extensibility. It leverages the modular capabilities approach defined in [ERC-5792](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5792#wallet_getcapabilities) to streamline connections and authentication into a single interaction.

## Motivation

Current standards like `eth_requestAccounts` and `personal_sign` lack extensibility and require separate interactions for connection and authentication. This results in added complexity for both users and developers. A unified and extensible RPC can enhance user experience, simplify development, and prepare for increasing sophistication in wallet interactions.

## Specification

### `wallet_connect`

Request the user to connect a single account and optionally confirm chain support and add capabilities.

#### RPC Specification

For each chain requested by the app, wallets MUST return a mapped capabilities object if the chain is supported and SHOULD return an empty object if no capabilities exist. Wallets MUST NOT return mapped capabilities objects for chains they do not support. If an app does not declare chains they would like to confirm support for, the wallet can return any chains it wishes to declare support for.

```typescript
type WalletConnectParams = [{
  version: string;
  capabilities?: Record<string,any>; // optional connection capabilities
}]

type WalletConnectResult = {
  accounts: {
    address: `0x${string}`; // connected account address
    capabilities: Record<string,any>; // results of this connection request's connection capabilities
  }[]
}
```

#### Example Parameters

```json
[{
  "version": "1",
  "capabilities": {
    "signInWithEthereum": {
      "nonce": "12345678",
      "chainId": "0x1"
    }
  }
}]
```

#### Example Result

```json
{
  "accounts": [
    {
      "address": "0x...",
      "capabilities": {
        "signInWithEthereum": {
          "message": "app.com wants you to sign in with your Ethereum account:\n0x...",
          "signature": "0x..."
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### `signInWithEthereum` Capability

Adds authentication using the [ERC-4361](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4361) Sign In WIth Ethereum standard.

#### Capability Specification

Same as ERC-4361 specification with minor modifications: 
* The casing of multi-word fields has been adjusted to mixedCase instead of hyphen-case. Resources are an array field. 
* The account address returned by `wallet_connect` MUST be the same address that is auto-inserted into the SIWE message.
* `version` is optional and defaults to an accepted version defined in ERC-4361 if not provided.
* `domain` is optional and defaults to the domain of the requesting app if not provided.
* `uri` is optional and defaults to the uri of the requesting app if not provided.
* `issuedAt` is optional and defaults to the current time if not provided.

The wallet MUST return a properly formatted ERC-4361 message that exactly matches the requested parameters and a signature over the EIP-191 hash of the message. The app SHOULD also verify that the two match for security.

```typescript
type SignInWithEthereumCapabilityParams = {
  nonce: string,
  chainId: string, // EIP-155 hex-encoded
  version?: string,
  scheme?: string,
  domain?: string,
  uri?: string,
  statement?: string
  issuedAt?: string
  expirationTime?: string,
  notBefore?: string,
  requestId?: string,
  resources?: string[]
}

type SignInWithEthereumCapabilityResult = {
  message: string, // formatted SIWE message
  signature: `0x${string}` // signed over EIP-191 hash of `message`
}
```

#### Example Parameters

```json
{
  "nonce": "12345678",
  "chainId": "0x1",
  "version": "1",
  "domain": "app.com",
  "uri": "https://app.com/connect",
  "issuedAt": "2024-12-35T04:20:00Z",
  "expirationTime": "2024-12-35T06:09:00Z"
}
```

#### Example Result

```json
{
  "message": "app.com wants you to sign in with your Ethereum account:\n0x...",
  "signature": "0x..."
}
```

## Rationale

### Multiple Accounts

Returning multiple accounts allows greater generality for apps that wish to interact in more complex ways with users. This also improves our backwards compatibility with `eth_requestAccounts`. In practice, we expect most apps only interact with the first account in the array.

### Capability Results

Returning capability results alongside the connection unlocks many valuable use cases such as authentication, user metadata sharing, and permissions granted to the app.

### Initial Authentication Capability

To ensure immediate value, this proposal includes a capability that combines wallet connection with authentication using the widely adopted [Sign In With Ethereum (ERC-4361)](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4361) standard. This optional capability simplifies the onboarding process for apps and users by combining two steps — connection and authentication — into a single interaction. Apps that prefer alternative authentication flows can implement their own capabilities without being constrained by this design.

By unifying connection and authentication into one step, apps can reduce friction, improve the user experience, and minimize redundant interactions.

## Backwards Compatibility

This standard builds on existing RPCs and complements ERC-5792 for future extensibility. Wallets can continue supporting legacy methods.

## Security Considerations

Applies [ERC-4361 security principles](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4361#security-considerations). As more capabilities are added, care must be taken to avoid unpredictable interactions.

## Privacy Considerations

Wallet addresses and any shared capabilities must be handled securely to avoid data leaks or man-in-the-middle attacks.
