## Abstract

This standard includes all needed information for adding a network to a wallet via URL, by including parameters such as `chainId`, `rpc_url`, `chain_name` and others, such that the network configuration is provided through the URL itself.

## Motivation

As observed with the use of [EIP-681](./eip-681.md) and its implementation in current mobile wallets, transactions can be made, approved, viewed, and used. However, if the wallet is instructed to perform a transaction on a chain they have not yet been configured before, the operation tends to fail.

This is understandable, as the `chain_id` provided makes up only one part of what is required to connect to a network. This EIP aims to introduce a new type of URL for usage with deep-linking, QR, and more, to allow users to seamlessly add new networks to their (for ex. mobile) wallet to then be able to more easily partake in `pay-`, `tx-`, or other Ethereum URL interactions.

As an extension to [EIP-831](./eip-831.md) and neighboring [EIP-681](./eip-681.md) and [EIP-2400](./eip-2400.md), this document aims to standardize the addition of new networks and switching thereof through the means of URLs. User convenience in this case is primary.

Introduction of this EIP is meant to bridge to a safer RPC listing system to be introduced in the near future.

## Specification

### Syntax

Network Switching URLs contain "ethereum" in their schema (protocol) part and are constructed as follows:

    network_add             = erc831_part "add" "@" chain_id [ "/" ] "?" parameters
    erc831_part             = "ethereum:network-"
    chain_id                = 1*DIGIT
    parameters              = parameter *( "&" parameter )
    parameter               = key "=" value
    key                     = required_keys / optional_keys
    required_keys           = "rpc_url" / "chain_name"
    optional_keys           = "name" / "symbol" / "decimals" / "explorer_url" / "icon_url"
    value                   = STRING / number
    number                  = 1*DIGIT

`STRING` is a URL-encoded Unicode string of arbitrary length, where delimiters and the
percentage symbol (`%`) are mandatorily hex-encoded with a `%` prefix.

If the *key* in the parameter is `decimals` the *value* MUST be a `number`.

### Semantics

`chain_id` is mandatory and denotes the decimal chain ID, such that we have the identifier of the network we would like to add.

`rpc_url` is represented as an array of RPC URLs. A minimum of 1 `rpc_url` MUST be present, in the format of `rpc_url=https%3A%2F%2Fpolygon-rpc.com`, or when multiple present `rpc_url=https%3A%2F%2Fpolygon-rpc.com&rpc_url=https%3A%2F%2Frpc-mainnet.matic.network`.

`chain_name` is required to specify the name of the network to be added.

`name` and `symbol` if provided, SHOULD be a human-readable string representing the native token.

`decimals` if provided, MUST be a non-negative integer representing the decimal precision of the native token.

`explorer_url` if provided, MUST specify one or more URLs pointing to block explorer web sites for the chain.

`icon_url` if provided, MUST specify one or more URLs pointing to reasonably sized images that can be used to visually identify the chain.

An example of adding a network with RPC endpoints `https://rpc-polygon.com` and `https://rpc-mainnet.matic.network`, the name `Polygon Mainnet`, token `Matic`, symbol `MATIC`, decimals `18`, explorer at `https://polygonscan.com/`, and Chain ID `137` would look as follows:

```URL
ethereum:network-add@137/?chain_name=Polygon%20Mainnet&rpc_url=https%3A%2F%2Frpc-polygon.com&rpc_url=https%3A%2F%2Frpc-mainnet.matic.network&name=Matic&symbol=MATIC&decimals=18&explorer_url=https%3A%2F%2Fpolygonscan.com
```

## Rationale

In furtherance of the Ethereum URL saga, network configuration is a needed addition to the possibility of Ethereum URLs. This would improve functionality for URLs, and offer non-mainnet users a way to connect without needing to configure their wallet by hand.

The URL follows [EIP-831](./eip-831.md) with the `PREFIX` being `network` and the `PAYLOAD` being a composite of `add` and [EIP-681](./eip-681.md)-like `chain_id` and parameters.

The choice for `PREFIX` being `network` is to allow further expansion and allow variants following the pattern `network-x`.

An example URL for adding the Optimism Network

```URL
ethereum:network-add@10/?chain_name=Optimistic%20Ethereum
&rpc_url=https%3A%2F%2Fmainnet.optimism.io&name=Ethereum&symbol=ETH&decimals=18&explorer_url=https%3A%2F%2Foptimistic.etherscan.io
```

The specification allows for a multitude of `rpc_url` and `explorer_url` to be specified. This is done such to overlap with parsing of the `TYPE` mentioned in [EIP-681](./eip-681.md).

## Security Considerations

URLs can be malformed to deceive users. Users SHOULD confirm source of URL before using any links. As well as checking source and transaction details before confirming any transactions. Applications SHOULD display network config, prior to network addition, such that users can confirm the validity of the network configuration being added.
