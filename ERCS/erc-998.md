## Abstract

An extension of the [ERC-721 standard](./eip-721.md) to enable ERC-721 tokens to own other ERC-721 tokens and [ERC-20](./eip-20.md) tokens.

An extension of the [ERC-20](./eip-20.md) and `ERC-223 https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/223` standards to enable ERC-20 and `ERC-223` tokens to be owned by ERC-721 tokens.

This specification covers four different kinds of composable tokens:

1. [`ERC998ERC721` top-down composable tokens that receive, hold and transfer ERC-721 tokens](#erc-721-top-down-composable)
2. [`ERC998ERC20` top-down composable tokens that receive, hold and transfer ERC-20 tokens](#erc-20-top-down-composable)
3. [`ERC998ERC721` bottom-up composable tokens that attach themselves to other ERC-721 tokens.](#erc-721-bottom-up-composable)
4. [`ERC998ERC20` bottom-up composable tokens that attach themselves to ERC-721 tokens.](#erc-20-bottom-up-composable)

which map to

1. An `ERC998ERC721` top-down composable is an ERC-721 token with additional functionality for owning other ERC-721 tokens. 
2. An `ERC998ERC20` top-down composable is an ERC-721 token with additional functionality for owning ERC-20 tokens. 
3. An `ERC998ERC721` bottom-up composable is an ERC-721 token with additional functionality for being owned by an ERC-721 token.
4. An `ERC998ERC20` bottom-up composable is an ERC-20 token with additional functionality for being owned by an ERC-721 token.

A top-down composable contract stores and keeps track of child tokens for each of its tokens.

A bottom-up composable contract stores and keeps track of a parent token for each its tokens.

With composable tokens it is possible to compose lists or trees of ERC-721 and ERC-20 tokens connected by ownership. Any such structure will have a single owner address at the root of the structure that is the owner of the entire composition. The entire composition can be transferred with one transaction by changing the root owner.

Different composables, top-down and bottom-up, have their advantages and disadvantages which are explained in the [Rational section](#rationale). It is possible for a token to be one or more kinds of composable token.

A non-fungible token is compliant and Composable of this EIP if it implements one or more of the following interfaces:

* `ERC998ERC721TopDown`
* `ERC998ERC20TopDown`
* `ERC998ERC721BottomUp`
* `ERC998ERC20BottomUp`

## Specification

### ERC-721

`ERC998ERC721` top-down, `ERC998ERC20` top-down, and `ERC998ERC721` bottom-up composable contracts must implement the [ERC-721 interface](./eip-721.md).

### ERC-20

`ERC998ERC20` bottom-up composable contracts must implement the [ERC-20 interface](./eip-20.md).

### [ERC-165](./eip-165.md)

The [ERC-165 standard](./eip-165.md) must be applied to each [ERC-998](./eip-998.md) interface that is used.

### Authentication

Authenticating whether a user or contract can execute some action works the same for both `ERC998ERC721` top-down and `ERC998ERC721` bottom-up composables.

A `rootOwner` refers to the owner address at the top of a tree of composables and ERC-721 tokens. 

Authentication within any composable is done by finding the rootOwner and comparing it to `msg.sender`, the return result of `getApproved(tokenId)` and the return result of `isApprovedForAll(rootOwner, msg.sender)`. If a match is found then authentication passes, otherwise authentication fails and the contract throws.

Here is an example of authentication code:

```solidity
address rootOwner = address(rootOwnerOf(_tokenId));
require(rootOwner == msg.sender || 
  isApprovedForAll(rootOwner,msg.sender) ||
  getApproved(tokenId) == msg.sender;
```

The `approve(address _approved, uint256 _tokenId)` and `getApproved(uint256 _tokenId)` ERC-721 functions are implemented specifically for the rootOwner. This enables a tree of composables to be transferred to a new rootOwner without worrying about which addresses have been approved in child composables, because any prior approves can only be used by the prior rootOwner.

Here are example implementations:

```solidity
function approve(address _approved, uint256 _tokenId) external {
  address rootOwner = address(rootOwnerOf(_tokenId));	
  require(rootOwner == msg.sender || isApprovedForAll(rootOwner,msg.sender));

  rootOwnerAndTokenIdToApprovedAddress[rootOwner][_tokenId] = _approved;
  emit Approval(rootOwner, _approved, _tokenId);
}

function getApproved(uint256 _tokenId) public view returns (address)  {
  address rootOwner = address(rootOwnerOf(_tokenId));
  return rootOwnerAndTokenIdToApprovedAddress[rootOwner][_tokenId];
}
```

### Traversal

The rootOwner of a composable is gotten by calling `rootOwnerOf(uint256 _tokenId)` or `rootOwnerOfChild(address _childContract, uint256 _childTokenId)`. These functions are used by top-down and bottom-up composables to traverse up the tree of composables and ERC-721 tokens to find the rootOwner.

`ERC998ERC721` top-down and bottom-up composables are interoperable with each other. It is possible for a top-down composable to own a bottom-up composable or for a top-down composable to own an ERC-721 token that owns a bottom-up token. In any configuration calling `rootOwnerOf(uint256 _tokenID)` on a composable will return the root owner address at the top of the ownership tree.

It is important to get the traversal logic of `rootOwnerOf` right. The logic for `rootOwnerOf` is the same whether or not a composable is bottom-up or top-down or both.
Here is the logic:

```
Logic for rootOwnerOf(uint256 _tokenId)

If the token is a bottom-up composable and has a parent token then call rootOwnerOf for the parent token.
    If the call was successful then the returned address is the rootOwner.
    Otherwise call rootOwnerOfChild for the parent token.
        If the call was successful then the returned address is the rootOwner.
        Otherwise get the owner address of the token and that is the rootOwner.
Otherwise call rootOwnerOfChild for the token
    If the call was successful then the returned address is the rootOwner.
    Otherwise get the owner address of the token and that is the rootOwner.
```

Calling `rootOwnerOfChild` for a token means the following logic:

```solidity
// Logic for calling rootOwnerOfChild for a tokenId
address tokenOwner = ownerOf(tokenId);
address childContract = address(this);
bytes32 rootOwner = ERC998ERC721(tokenOwner).rootOwnerOfChild(childContract, tokenId);
```

But understand that the real call to `rootOwnerOfChild` should be made with assembly so that the code can check if the call failed and so that the `staticcall` opcode is used to ensure that no state is modified.

Tokens/contracts that implement the above authentication and traversal functionality are "composable aware".

### Composable Transfer Function Parameter Format

Composable functions that make transfers follow the same parameter format: **from:to:what**.

For example the `getChild(address _from, uint256 _tokenId, address _childContract, uint256 _childTokenId)` composable function transfers an ERC-721 token from an address to a top-down composable. The `_from` parameter is the **from**, the `_tokenId` parameter is the **to** and the `address _childContract, uint256 _childTokenId` parameters are the **what**.

Another example is the `safeTransferChild(uint256 _fromTokenId, address _to, address _childContract, uint256 _childTokenId)` function. The `_fromTokenId` is the **from**, the `_to` is the **to** and the `address _childContract, address _childTokenId` parameters are the **what**.

### transferFrom/safeTransferFrom Functions Do Not Transfer Tokens Owned By Tokens

In bottom-up and top-down composable contracts the `transferFrom` and `safeTransferFrom` functions must throw if they are called directly to transfer a token that is owned by another token.

The reason for this is that these functions do not explicitly specify which token owns a token to be transferred. [See the rational section for more information about this.](#explicit-transfer-parameters)

`transferFrom/safeTransferFrom` functions must be used to transfer tokens that are owned by an address.


### ERC-721 Top-Down Composable

ERC-721 top-down composables act as containers for ERC-721 tokens. 

ERC-721 top-down composables are ERC-721 tokens that can receive, hold and transfer ERC-721 tokens.

There are two ways to transfer a ERC-721 token to a top-down composable:

1. Use the `function safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _tokenId, bytes data)` function. The `_to` argument is the top-down composable contract address. The `bytes data` argument holds the integer value of the top-down composable tokenId that the ERC-721 token is transferred to.
2. Call `approve` in the ERC-721 token contract for the top-down composable contract. Then call `getChild` in the composable contract.

The first ways is for ERC-721 contracts that have a `safeTransferFrom` function. The second way is for contracts that do not have this function such as cryptokitties.

Here is an example of transferring ERC-721 token 3 from an address to top-down composable token 6:

```solidity
uint256 tokenId = 6;
bytes memory tokenIdBytes = new bytes(32);
assembly { mstore(add(tokenIdBytes, 32), tokenId) }
ERC721(contractAddress).safeTransferFrom(userAddress, composableAddress, 3, tokenIdBytes);
```

Every ERC-721 top-down composable compliant contract must implement the `ERC998ERC721TopDown` interface.

The `ERC998ERC721TopDownEnumerable` and `ERC998ERC20TopDownEnumerable` interfaces are optional.

#### `rootOwnerOf` 1

```solidity
/// @notice Get the root owner of tokenId.
/// @param _tokenId The token to query for a root owner address
/// @return rootOwner The root owner at the top of tree of tokens and ERC-998 magic value.
function rootOwnerOf(uint256 _tokenId) public view returns (bytes32 rootOwner);
```

This function traverses token owners until the root owner address of `_tokenId` is found.

The first 4 bytes of rootOwner contain the ERC-998 magic value `0xcd740db5`. The last 20 bytes contain the root owner address.

The magic value is returned because this function may be called on contracts when it is unknown if the contracts have a `rootOwnerOf` function. The magic value is used in such calls to ensure a valid return value is received.

If it is unknown whether a contract has the `rootOwnerOf` function then the first four bytes of the `rootOwner` return value must be compared to `0xcd740db5`. 

`0xcd740db5` is equal to:

```solidity
this.rootOwnerOf.selector ^ this.rootOwnerOfChild.selector ^ 
this.tokenOwnerOf.selector ^ this.ownerOfChild.selector;
```

Here is an example of a value returned by `rootOwnerOf`.
`0xcd740db50000000000000000e5240103e1ff986a2c8ae6b6728ffe0d9a395c59`

#### rootOwnerOfChild

```solidity
/// @notice Get the root owner of a child token.
/// @param _childContract The contract address of the child token.
/// @param _childTokenId The tokenId of the child.
/// @return rootOwner The root owner at the top of tree of tokens and ERC-998 magic value.
function rootOwnerOfChild(
  address _childContract, 
  uint256 _childTokenId
) 
  public 
  view 
  returns (bytes32 rootOwner);
```

This function traverses token owners until the root owner address of the supplied child token is found.

The first 4 bytes of rootOwner contain the ERC-998 magic value `0xcd740db5`. The last 20 bytes contain the root owner address.

The magic value is returned because this function may be called on contracts when it is unknown if the contracts have a `rootOwnerOf` function. The magic value is used in such calls to ensure a valid return value is received.

If it is unknown whether a contract has the `rootOwnerOfChild` function then the first four bytes of the `rootOwner` return value must be compared to `0xcd740db5`. 

#### ownerOfChild

```solidity
/// @notice Get the parent tokenId of a child token.
/// @param _childContract The contract address of the child token.
/// @param _childTokenId The tokenId of the child.
/// @return parentTokenOwner The parent address of the parent token and ERC-998 magic value
/// @return parentTokenId The parent tokenId of _tokenId
function ownerOfChild(
  address _childContract, 
  uint256 _childTokenId
) 
  external 
  view 
  returns (
    address parentTokenOwner, 
    uint256 parentTokenId
  );
```

This function is used to get the parent tokenId of a child token and get the owner address of the parent token.

The first 4 bytes of parentTokenOwner contain the ERC-998 magic value `0xcd740db5`. The last 20 bytes contain the parent token owner address.

The magic value is returned because this function may be called on contracts when it is unknown if the contracts have a `ownerOfChild` function. The magic value is used in such calls to ensure a valid return value is received.

If it is unknown whether a contract has the `ownerOfChild` function then the first four bytes of the `parentTokenOwner` return value must be compared to `0xcd740db5`. 

#### `onERC721Received`

```solidity
/// @notice A token receives a child token
/// @param _operator The address that caused the transfer.
/// @param _from The prior owner of the child token.
/// @param _childTokenId The token that is being transferred to the parent.
/// @param _data Up to the first 32 bytes contains an integer which is the receiving parent tokenId.  
function onERC721Received(
  address _operator, 
  address _from, 
  uint256 _childTokenId, 
  bytes _data
) 
  external 
  returns(bytes4);
```

This is a function defined in the ERC-721 standard. This function is called in an ERC-721 contract when `safeTransferFrom` is called. The `bytes _data` argument contains an integer value from 1 to 32 bytes long that is the parent tokenId that an ERC-721 token is transferred to. 

The `onERC721Received` function is how a top-down composable contract is notified that an ERC-721 token has been transferred to it and what tokenId in the top-down composable is the parent tokenId.

The return value for `onERC721Received` is the magic value `0x150b7a02` which is equal to `bytes4(keccak256(abi.encodePacked("onERC721Received(address,address,uint256,bytes)")))`.

#### transferChild

```solidity
/// @notice Transfer child token from top-down composable to address.
/// @param _fromTokenId The owning token to transfer from.
/// @param _to The address that receives the child token
/// @param _childContract The ERC-721 contract of the child token.
/// @param _childTokenId The tokenId of the token that is being transferred.
function transferChild(
  uint256 _fromTokenId,
  address _to, 
  address _childContract, 
  uint256 _childTokenId
) 
  external;
```

This function authenticates `msg.sender` and transfers a child token from a top-down composable to a different address. 

This function makes this call within it:

```solidity
ERC721(_childContract).transferFrom(this, _to, _childTokenId);
```

#### safeTransferChild 1

```solidity
/// @notice Transfer child token from top-down composable to address.
/// @param _fromTokenId The owning token to transfer from.
/// @param _to The address that receives the child token
/// @param _childContract The ERC-721 contract of the child token.
/// @param _childTokenId The tokenId of the token that is being transferred.
function safeTransferChild(
  uint256 _fromTokenId,
  address _to, 
  address _childContract, 
  uint256 _childTokenId
) 
  external;
```

This function authenticates `msg.sender` and transfers a child token from a top-down composable to a different address. 

This function makes this call within it:

```solidity
ERC721(_childContract).safeTransferFrom(this, _to, _childTokenId);
```

#### safeTransferChild 2

```solidity
/// @notice Transfer child token from top-down composable to address or other top-down composable.
/// @param _fromTokenId The owning token to transfer from.
/// @param _to The address that receives the child token
/// @param _childContract The ERC721 contract of the child token.
/// @param _childTokenId The tokenId of the token that is being transferred.
/// @param _data Additional data with no specified format, can be used to specify tokenId to transfer to
function safeTransferChild(
  uint256 _fromTokenId,
  address _to, 
  address _childContract, 
  uint256 _childTokenId, 
  bytes _data
) 
  external;
```

This function authenticates `msg.sender` and transfers a child token from a top-down composable to a different address or to a different top-down composable.

A child token is transferred to a different top-down composable if the `_to` address is a top-down composable contract and `bytes _data` is supplied an integer representing the parent tokenId.

This function makes this call within it: 

```solidity
ERC721(_childContract).safeTransferFrom(this, _to, _childTokenId, _data);
```

#### transferChildToParent

```solidity
/// @notice Transfer bottom-up composable child token from top-down composable to other ERC-721 token.
/// @param _fromTokenId The owning token to transfer from.
/// @param _toContract The ERC-721 contract of the receiving token
/// @param _toToken The receiving token  
/// @param _childContract The bottom-up composable contract of the child token.
/// @param _childTokenId The token that is being transferred.
/// @param _data Additional data with no specified format
function transferChildToParent(
  uint256 _fromTokenId, 
  address _toContract, 
  uint256 _toTokenId, 
  address _childContract, 
  uint256 _childTokenId, 
  bytes _data
) 
  external
```

This function authenticates `msg.sender` and transfers a child bottom-up composable token from a top-down composable to a different ERC-721 token. This function can only be used when the child token is a bottom-up composable token. It is designed to transfer a bottom-up composable token from a top-down composable to an ERC-721 token (bottom-up style) in one transaction.

This function makes this call within it:

```solidity
ERC998ERC721BottomUp(_childContract).transferToParent(
  address(this), 
  _toContract, 
  _toTokenId, 
  _childTokenId, 
  _data
);
```

#### getChild 

```solidity
/// @notice Get a child token from an ERC-721 contract.
/// @param _from The address that owns the child token.
/// @param _tokenId The token that becomes the parent owner
/// @param _childContract The ERC-721 contract of the child token
/// @param _childTokenId The tokenId of the child token
function getChild(
  address _from, 
  uint256 _tokenId, 
  address _childContract, 
  uint256 _childTokenId
) 
  external;
```

This function is used to transfer an ERC-721 token when its contract does not have a `safeTransferChild(uint256 _fromTokenId, address _to, address _childContract, uint256 _childTokenId, bytes _data)` function.

A transfer with this function is done in two steps:

1. The owner of the ERC-721 token calls `approve` or `setApprovalForAll` in the ERC-721 contract for the top-down composable contract.
2. The owner of the ERC-721 token calls `getChild` in the top-down composable contract for the ERC-721 token.

The `getChild` function must authenticate that `msg.sender` is the owner of the ERC-721 token in the ERC-721 contract or is approved or an operator of the ERC-721 token in the ERC-721 contract.

#### ERC-721 Top-Down Composable Enumeration

Optional interface for top-down composable enumeration:

```solidity

### ERC-20 Top-Down Composable

ERC-20 top-down composables act as containers for ERC-20 tokens.
  
ERC-20 top-down composables are ERC-721 tokens that can receive, hold and transfer ERC-20 tokens.

There are two ways to transfer ERC-20 tokens to an ERC-20 Top-Down Composable:

1. Use the `transfer(address _to, uint256 _value, bytes _data);` function from the `ERC-223` contract. The `_to` argument is the ERC-20 top-down composable contract address. The `_value` argument is how many ERC-20 tokens to transfer. The `bytes` argument holds the integer value of the top-down composable tokenId that receives the ERC-20 tokens.
2. Call `approve` in the ERC-20 contract for the ERC-20 top-down composable contract. Then call `getERC20(address _from, uint256 _tokenId, address _erc20Contract, uint256 _value)` from the ERC-20 top-down composable contract.

The first way is for ERC-20 contracts that support the `ERC-223` standard. The second way is for contracts that do not.

ERC-20 top-down composables implement the following interface:
  
```solidity
/// @title `ERC998ERC20` Top-Down Composable Non-Fungible Token

#### tokenFallback

```solidity
/// @notice A token receives ERC-20 tokens
/// @param _from The prior owner of the ERC-20 tokens
/// @param _value The number of ERC-20 tokens received
/// @param _data Up to the first 32 bytes contains an integer which is the receiving tokenId.  
function tokenFallback(address _from, uint256 _value, bytes _data) external;  
```

This function comes from the `ERC-223` which is an extension of the ERC-20 standard. This function is called on the receiving contract from the sending contract when ERC-20 tokens are transferred. This function is how the ERC-20 top-down composable contract gets notified that one of its tokens received ERC-20 tokens. Which token received ERC-20 tokens is specified in the `_data` parameter.

#### `balanceOfERC20`

```solidity
/// @notice Look up the balance of ERC-20 tokens for a specific token and ERC-20 contract
/// @param _tokenId The token that owns the ERC-20 tokens
/// @param _erc20Contract The ERC-20 contract
/// @return The number of ERC-20 tokens owned by a token from an ERC-20 contract
function balanceOfERC20(
  uint256 _tokenId, 
  address _erc20Contract
) 
  external 
  view 
  returns(uint256);
```

Gets the balance of ERC-20 tokens owned by a token from a specific ERC-20 contract.

#### `transferERC20`

```solidity
/// @notice Transfer ERC-20 tokens to address
/// @param _tokenId The token to transfer from
/// @param _value The address to send the ERC-20 tokens to
/// @param _erc20Contract The ERC-20 contract
/// @param _value The number of ERC-20 tokens to transfer
function transferERC20(
  uint256 _tokenId, 
  address _to, 
  address _erc20Contract, 
  uint256 _value
)
  external;
```

This is used to transfer ERC-20 tokens from a token to an address. This function calls `ERC20(_erc20Contract).transfer(_to, _value)`;

This function must authenticate `msg.sender`.

#### `transferERC223`

```solidity
  /// @notice Transfer ERC-20 tokens to address or ERC-20 top-down composable
  /// @param _tokenId The token to transfer from
  /// @param _value The address to send the ERC-20 tokens to
  /// @param _erc223Contract The `ERC-223` token contract
  /// @param _value The number of ERC-20 tokens to transfer
  /// @param _data Additional data with no specified format, can be used to specify tokenId to transfer to
  function transferERC223(
    uint256 _tokenId, 
    address _to, 
    address _erc223Contract, 
    uint256 _value, 
    bytes _data
  )
    external;
```

This function is from the `ERC-223`. It is used to transfer ERC-20 tokens from a token to an address or to another token by putting an integer token value in the `_data` argument.

This function must authenticate `msg.sender`.

#### `getERC20`

```solidity
/// @notice Get ERC-20 tokens from ERC-20 contract.
/// @param _from The current owner address of the ERC-20 tokens that are being transferred.
/// @param _tokenId The token to transfer the ERC-20 tokens to.
/// @param _erc20Contract The ERC-20 token contract
/// @param _value The number of ERC-20 tokens to transfer  
function getERC20(
  address _from, 
  uint256 _tokenId, 
  address _erc20Contract, 
  uint256 _value
) 
  external;
```

This function is used to transfer ERC-20 tokens to an ERC-20 top-down composable when an ERC-20 contract does not have a `transferERC223(uint256 _tokenId, address _to, address _erc223Contract, uint256 _value, bytes _data)` function.

Before this function can be used the ERC-20 top-down composable contract address must be approved in the ERC-20 contract to transfer the ERC-20 tokens.

This function must authenticate that `msg.sender` equals `_from` or has been approved in the ERC-20 contract.

#### ERC-20 Top-Down Composable Enumeration

Optional interface for top-down composable enumeration:

```solidity

    returns(address);
}
```

### ERC-721 Bottom-Up Composable

ERC-721 bottom-up composables are ERC-721 tokens that attach themselves to other ERC-721 tokens.

ERC-721 bottom-up composable contracts store the owning address of a token and the parent tokenId if any.

```solidity
/// @title `ERC998ERC721` Bottom-Up Composable Non-Fungible Token

  /// @dev This emits when a token is transferred from an ERC-721 token
  /// @param _fromContract The contract the token is transferred from
  /// @param _fromTokenId The token the token is transferred from
  /// @param _tokenId The token that is transferred  
  event TransferFromParent(
    address indexed _fromContract, 
    uint256 indexed _fromTokenId,

  );
  
  /// @notice Get the root owner of tokenId.

      bool isParent
    );
 
  /// @notice Transfer token from owner address to a token

    bytes _data
  )
    external;
}
```

#### `rootOwnerOf`

```solidity
/// @notice Get the root owner of tokenId.
/// @param _tokenId The token to query for a root owner address
/// @return rootOwner The root owner at the top of tree of tokens and ERC-998 magic value.
function rootOwnerOf(uint256 _tokenId) public view returns (bytes32 rootOwner);
```

This function traverses token owners until the root owner address of `_tokenId` is found.

The first 4 bytes of rootOwner contain the ERC-998 magic value `0xcd740db5`. The last 20 bytes contain the root owner address.

The magic value is returned because this function may be called on contracts when it is unknown if the contracts have a `rootOwnerOf` function. The magic value is used in such calls to ensure a valid return value is received.

If it is unknown whether a contract has the `rootOwnerOf` function then the first four bytes of the `rootOwner` return value must be compared to `0xcd740db5`. 

`0xcd740db5` is equal to:

```solidity
this.rootOwnerOf.selector ^ this.rootOwnerOfChild.selector ^ 
this.tokenOwnerOf.selector ^ this.ownerOfChild.selector;
```

Here is an example of a value returned by `rootOwnerOf`.
`0xcd740db50000000000000000e5240103e1ff986a2c8ae6b6728ffe0d9a395c59`

#### tokenOwnerOf

```solidity
/// @notice Get the owner address and parent token (if there is one) of a token
/// @param _tokenId The tokenId to query.
/// @return tokenOwner The owner address of the token and ERC-998 magic value.
/// @return parentTokenId The parent owner of the token
/// @return isParent True if parentTokenId is a valid parent tokenId and false if there is no parent tokenId
function tokenOwnerOf(
  uint256 _tokenId
)
  external 
  view 
  returns (
    bytes32 tokenOwner, 
    uint256 parentTokenId, 
    bool isParent
  );
```

This function is used to get the owning address and parent tokenId of a token if there is one stored in the contract.

If `isParent` is true then `tokenOwner` is the owning ERC-721 contract address and `parentTokenId` is a valid parent tokenId. If `isParent` is false then `tokenOwner` is a user address and `parentTokenId` does not contain a valid parent tokenId and must be ignored.

The first 4 bytes of `tokenOwner` contain the ERC-998 magic value `0xcd740db5`. The last 20 bytes contain the token owner address.

The magic value is returned because this function may be called on contracts when it is unknown if the contracts have a `tokenOwnerOf` function. The magic value is used in such calls to ensure a valid return value is received.

If it is unknown whether a contract has the `rootOwnerOf` function then the first four bytes of the `tokenOwner` return value must be compared to `0xcd740db5`. 

#### transferToParent

```solidity
/// @notice Transfer token from owner address to a token
/// @param _from The owner address
/// @param _toContract The ERC-721 contract of the receiving token
/// @param _toToken The receiving token

function transferToParent(
  address _from, 
  address _toContract, 
  uint256 _toTokenId, 
  uint256 _tokenId, 
  bytes _data
)
  external;
```

This function is used to transfer a token from an address to a token. `msg.sender` must be authenticated.

This function must check that `_toToken` exists in `_toContract` and throw if not.

#### transferFromParent

```solidity
/// @notice Transfer token from a token to an address
/// @param _fromContract The address of the owning contract
/// @param _fromTokenId The owning token
/// @param _to The address the token is transferred to.
/// @param _tokenId The token that is transferred
/// @param _data Additional data with no specified format
function transferFromParent(
  address _fromContract, 
  uint256 _fromTokenId, 
  address _to, 
  uint256 _tokenId, 
  bytes _data
)
  external;
```

This function is used to transfer a token from a token to an address. `msg.sender` must be authenticated.

This function must check that `_fromContract` and `_fromTokenId` own `_tokenId` and throw not.

#### transferAsChild

```solidity
/// @notice Transfer a token from a token to another token
/// @param _fromContract The address of the owning contract
/// @param _fromTokenId The owning token
/// @param _toContract The ERC-721 contract of the receiving token

  uint256 _fromTokenId, 
  address _toContract, 
  uint256 _toTokenId, 
  uint256 _tokenId, 
  bytes _data
)
  external;
```

This function is used to transfer a token from a token to another token. `msg.sender` must be authenticated.

This function must check that `_toToken` exists in `_toContract` and throw if not.

This function must check that `_fromContract` and `_fromTokenId` own `_tokenId` and throw if not.

### ERC-20 Bottom-Up Composable

ERC-20 bottom-up composables are ERC-20 tokens that attach themselves to ERC-721 tokens, or are owned by a user address like standard ERC-20 tokens.

When owned by an ERC-721 token, ERC-20 bottom-up composable contracts store the owning address of a token and the parent tokenId. ERC-20 bottom-up composables add several methods to the ERC-20 and `ERC-223` interfaces allowing for querying the balance of parent tokens, and transferring tokens to, from, and between parent tokens.

This functionality can be implemented by adding one additional mapping to track balances of tokens, in addition to the standard mapping for tracking user address balances.

```solidity
/// @dev This mapping tracks standard ERC20/`ERC-223` ownership, where an address owns
///  a particular amount of tokens.
mapping(address => uint) userBalances;

/// @dev This additional mapping tracks ERC-998 ownership, where an ERC-721 token owns
///  a particular amount of tokens. This tracks contractAddres => tokenId => balance
mapping(address => mapping(uint => uint)) nftBalances;
```

The complete interface is below.

```solidity
/// @title `ERC998ERC20` Bottom-Up Composable Fungible Token

#### balanceOfToken

```solidity
/// @notice Get the balance of a non-fungible parent token
/// @param _tokenContract The contract tracking the parent token
/// @param _tokenId The ID of the parent token
/// @return amount The balance of the token
function balanceOfToken(
  address _tokenContract, 
  uint256 _tokenId
)
  external
  view
  returns (uint256 amount);
```

This function returns the balance of a non-fungible token. It mirrors the standard ERC-20 method `balanceOf`, but accepts the address of the parent token's contract, and the parent token's ID. This method behaves identically to `balanceOf`, but checks for ownership by ERC-721 tokens rather than user addresses.

#### `transferToParent`

```solidity
/// @notice Transfer tokens from owner address to a token
/// @param _from The owner address
/// @param _toContract The ERC-721 contract of the receiving token
/// @param _toToken The receiving token
/// @param _amount The amount of tokens to transfer
function transferToParent(
  address _from, 
  address _toContract, 
  uint256 _toTokenId, 
  uint256 _amount
)
  external;
```

This function transfers an amount of tokens from a user address to an ERC-721 token. This function MUST ensure that the recipient contract implements ERC-721 using the ERC-165 `supportsInterface` function. This function SHOULD ensure that the recipient token actually exists, by calling `ownerOf` on the recipient token's contract, and ensuring it neither throws nor returns the zero address. This function MUST emit the `TransferToParent` event upon a successful transfer (in addition to the standard ERC-20 `Transfer` event!). This function MUST throw if the `_from` account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.

#### `transferFromParent`

```solidity
/// @notice Transfer token from a token to an address
/// @param _fromContract The address of the owning contract
/// @param _fromTokenId The owning token
/// @param _to The address the token is transferred to
/// @param _amount The amount of tokens to transfer
function transferFromParent(
  address _fromContract, 
  uint256 _fromTokenId, 
  address _to, 
  uint256 _amount
)

This function transfers an amount of tokens from an ERC-721 token to an address. This function MUST emit the `TransferFromParent` event upon a successful transfer (in addition to the standard ERC-20 `Transfer` event!). This function MUST throw if the balance of the sender ERC-721 token is less than the `_amount` specified. This function MUST verify that the `msg.sender` owns the sender ERC-721 token, and MUST throw otherwise.

#### `transferFromParentERC223`

```solidity
/// @notice Transfer token from a token to an address, using `ERC-223` semantics
/// @param _fromContract The address of the owning contract
/// @param _fromTokenId The owning token
/// @param _to The address the token is transferred to
/// @param _amount The amount of tokens to transfer
/// @param _data Additional data with no specified format, can be used to specify the sender tokenId

  address _to, 
  uint256 _amount, 
  bytes _data
)
  external;
```

This function transfers an amount of tokens from an ERC-721 token to an address. This function has identical requirements to `transferFromParent`, except that it additionally MUST invoke `tokenFallback` on the recipient address, if the address is a contract, as specified by `ERC-223`.

#### transferAsChild 1

```solidity
/// @notice Transfer a token from a token to another token
/// @param _fromContract The address of the owning contract
/// @param _fromTokenId The owning token
/// @param _toContract The ERC-721 contract of the receiving token
/// @param _toToken The receiving token
/// @param _amount The amount tokens to transfer
function transferAsChild(
  address _fromContract, 
  uint256 _fromTokenId, 
  address _toContract, 
  uint256 _toTokenId, 
  uint256 _amount
)
  external;
```

This function transfers an amount of tokens from an ERC-721 token to another ERC-721 token. This function MUST emit BOTH the `TransferFromParent` and `TransferToParent` events (in addition to the standard ERC-20 `Transfer` event!). This function MUST throw if the balance of the sender ERC-721 token is less than the `_amount` specified. This function MUST verify that the `msg.sender` owns the sender ERC-721 token, and MUST throw otherwise. This function MUST ensure that the recipient contract implements ERC-721 using the ERC-165 `supportsInterface` function. This function SHOULD ensure that the recipient token actually exists, by calling `ownerOf` on the recipient token's contract, and ensuring it neither throws nor returns the zero address.

### Notes

For backwards-compatibility, implementations MUST emit the standard ERC-20 `Transfer` event when a transfer occurs, regardless of whether the sender and recipient are addresses or ERC-721 tokens. In the case that either sender or recipient are tokens, the corresponding parameter in the `Transfer` event SHOULD be the contract address of the token.

Implementations MUST implement all ERC-20 and `ERC-223` functions in addition to the functions specified in this interface.

## Rationale

Two different kinds of composable (top-down and bottom-up) exist to handle different use cases. A regular ERC-721 token cannot own a top-down composable, but it can own a bottom-up composable. A bottom-up composable cannot own a regular ERC-721 but a top-down composable can own a regular ERC-721 token. Having multiple kinds of composables enable different token ownership possibilities.

### Which Kind of Composable To Use?

If you want to transfer regular ERC-721 tokens to non-fungible tokens, then use top-down composables.

If you want to transfer non-fungible tokens to regular ERC-721 tokens then use bottom-up composables.

### Explicit Transfer Parameters

Every ERC-998 transfer function includes explicit parameters to specify the prior owner and the new owner of a token. Explicitly providing **from** and **to** is done intentionally to avoid situations where tokens are transferred in unintended ways.

Here is an example of what could occur if **from** was not explicitly provided in transfer functions:
> An exchange contract is an approved operator in a specific composable contract for user A, user B and user C.
>
> User A transfers token 1 to user B. At the same time the exchange contract transfers token 1 to user C (with the implicit intention to transfer from user A). User B gets token 1 for a minute before it gets incorrectly transferred to user C. The second transfer should have failed but it didn't because no explicit **from** was provided to ensure that token 1 came from user A.

## Backwards Compatibility

Composables are designed to work with ERC-721, `ERC-223` and ERC-20 tokens.

Some older ERC-721 contracts do not have a `safeTransferFrom` function. The `getChild` function can still be used to transfer a token to an ERC-721 top-down composable.

If an ERC-20 contract does not have the `ERC-223` function `transfer(address _to, uint _value, bytes _data)` then the `getERC20` function can still be used to transfer ERC-20 tokens to an ERC-20 top-down composable.
