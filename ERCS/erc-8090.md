## Abstract

EIP-8090 introduces a relayer-protected gasless swap pattern optimised for Uniswap V4 periphery contracts. The mechanism enforces that every gasless swap involves at least one stablecoin leg, automatically burns a configurable percentage fee (default 1%) of the stablecoin USD volume directly from the user's balance, and embeds the current fee rate in the [EIP-712](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712) signature to prevent replay attacks when parameters are updated. All operations execute atomically within the V4 `unlockCallback`, providing maximal security and MEV resistance while eliminating the risk of relayer loss.

**TL;DR**: A battle-tested periphery contract for Uniswap V4 that makes gasless swaps relayer-profitable by mandating stablecoin involvement and atomic fee burning, while enabling swap-only mining rewards.

## Motivation

Gasless trading is required for mass adoption, yet all existing solutions expose relayers to sustained losses from spam and zero-fee transactions.

This ERC eliminates relayer risk while preserving atomic execution and requiring no trusted forwarder.

## Specification

The periphery contract MUST implement:

```solidity
uint256 public gaslessFeeRate; // denominator, 100 = 1%
mapping(address => bool) public isStableCoin;
```

[EIP-712](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712) ensures structured signing with replay protection via the embedded `feeRate`.

```
Swap(address caller,PoolKey key,SwapParams params,bytes hookData,uint256 feeRate,uint256 deadline)
```
The `feeRate` field must equal the contract's current `gaslessFeeRate` at the time of signing.

## Rationale

This is the only known gasless swap design that is inherently profitable for relayers, maintains atomic execution, and requires no trusted forwarder.

## Backwards Compatibility

Fully compatible with Uniswap V4 core and Permit2.

## Security Considerations

- Replay protection via embedded feeRate
- Atomic execution in callback
- Relayer zero-loss guarantee via callStatic simulation
- No trusted forwarder
- Battle-tested at scale
