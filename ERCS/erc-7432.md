## Abstract

This standard introduces role management for NFTs. Each role assignment is associated with a single NFT and expires
automatically at a given timestamp. Roles are defined as `bytes32` and feature a custom `data` field of arbitrary size
to allow customization.

## Motivation

The NFT Roles interface aims to establish a standard for role management in NFTs. Tracking on-chain roles enables
decentralized applications (dApps) to implement access control for privileged actions, e.g., minting tokens with a role
(airdrop claim rights).

NFT roles can be deeply integrated with dApps to create a utility-sharing mechanism. A good example is in digital real
estate. A user can create a digital property NFT and grant a `keccak256("PropertyManager()")` role to another user,
allowing them to delegate specific utility without compromising ownership. The same user could also grant a
`keccak256("PropertyTenant(uint256)")` role to other users, allowing the recipient to access and interact with the
digital property.

There are also interesting use cases in decentralized finance (DeFi). Insurance policies could be issued as NFTs, and 
the beneficiaries, insured, and insurer could all be on-chain roles tracked using this standard.

## Specification

The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED",
"NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC-2119 and RFC-8174.

Compliant contracts MUST implement the following interface:

### Metadata Extension

The Roles Metadata extension extends the traditional JSON-based metadata schema of NFTs. Therefore, DApps supporting
this feature MUST also implement the metadata extension of [ERC-721](./eip-721.md). This extension is **optional** and allows
developers to provide additional information for roles.

Updated Metadata Schema:

```js
{
  
  /** Existing NFT Metadata **/

  "title": "Asset Metadata",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "name": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "Identifies the asset to which this NFT represents"
    },
    "description": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "Describes the asset to which this NFT represents"
    },
    "image": {
      "type": "string",
      "description": "A URI pointing to a resource with mime type image/* representing the asset to which this NFT represents. Consider making any images at a width between 320 and 1080 pixels and aspect ratio between 1.91:1 and 4:5 inclusive"
    }
  },
  
  /** Additional fields for Roles **/

  "roles": [
    {
      "id": {
        "type": "bytes32",
        "description": "Identifies the role"
      },
      "name": {
        "type": "string",
        "description": "Human-readable name of the role"
      },
      "description": {
        "type": "string",
        "description": "Describes the role"
      },
      "inputs": [
        {
          "name": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "Human-readable name of the argument"
          },
          "type": {
            "type": "string",
            "description": "Solidity type, e.g., uint256 or address"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
  
}
```

The following JSON is an example of [ERC-7432](./eip-7432.md) Metadata:

```js
{
  // ... Existing NFT Metadata
  
  "roles": [
    {
      // keccak256("PropertyManager()")
      "id": "0x76be0ffb73d8cd9e8fa76c28632ebbc3865a8ec7a0b6acab6ac589a1c88dd301",
      "name": "Property Manager",
      "description": "The manager of the property is responsible for furnishing it and ensuring its good condition.",
      "inputs": []
    },
    {
      // keccak256("PropertyTenant(uint256)")
      "id": "0x17dfc8ea82661b71bd62ce0bd9db3858dd8f3e8ab9799d6ab468ec64f1be21a5",
      "name": "Property Tenant",
      "description": "The tenant of the property is responsible for paying the rent and keeping the property in good condition.",
      "inputs": [
        {
          "name": "rent",
          "type": "uint256"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
  
}
```

The `roles` array properties are SUGGESTED, and developers should add any other relevant information as necessary (e.g.,
an image for the role). It's also important to highlight the importance of the `inputs` property. This field describes
the parameters that should be encoded and passed to the `grantRole` function. It's RECOMMENDED to use the properties
`type` and `components` defined on the Solidity ABI Specification, where `type` is the canonical type of the parameter,
and `components` is used for complex tuple types.

### Caveats

* Compliant contracts MUST implement the `IERC7432` interface.
* A role is represented by a `bytes32`, and it's RECOMMENDED to use the `keccak256` of the role's name with its inputs:
  `bytes32 roleId = keccak256("RoleName(input_type)")`.
* The `grantRole` function MUST revert if the `expirationDate` is in the past or if the `msg.sender` is not approved to
  grant roles on behalf of the NFT owner. It MAY be implemented as `public` or `external`.
* In addition to emitting the `RoleGranted` event, the `grantRole` function MUST emit a `TokenLocked` event if the token
  is frozen or transferred to an escrow account.
* The `revokeRole` function MUST revert if the `msg.sender` is not approved to revoke roles on behalf of the original
  NFT owner or the `recipient`. It MAY be implemented as `public` or `external`.
* If `revocable` is false, only the `recipient` can revoke the role. If `revocable` is true, both the `recipient` and
  the original NFT owner can revoke the role.
* The `unlockToken` function MUST revert if the `msg.sender` is not approved, or if there is at least one non-revocable
  role not expired. It MAY be implemented as `public` or `external`.
* The `setRoleApprovalForAll` function MAY be implemented as `public` or `external`.
* The `ownerOf` function MAY be implemented as `pure` or `view`, and MUST return the address of the original owner of
  the NFT.
* The `recipientOf` function MAY be implemented as `pure` or `view`, and MUST return the address of the account that
  received the role.
* The `roleData` function MAY be implemented as `pure` or `view`, and MUST return the encoded data passed to the
  `grantRole` function.
* The `roleExpirationDate` function MAY be implemented as `pure` or `view`, and MUST return the expiration date of a
  given role.
* The `isRoleRevocable` function MAY be implemented as `pure` or `view`, and MUST return whether the role is revocable.
* The `isRoleApprovedForAll` function MAY be implemented as `pure` or `view`, and SHOULD only return `true` if the
  `_operator` is approved to grant and revoke roles on behalf of the original NFT owner.
* Compliant contracts SHOULD implement [ERC-165](./eip-165.md).

## Rationale

[ERC-7432](./eip-7432.md) IS NOT an extension of [ERC-721](./eip-721.md). The main reason behind this decision is to
enable it to be implemented externally or on the same contract as the NFT, allowing dApps to implement roles with
immutable assets. This standard covers many crucial features, such as automatic expiration and custom data, but perhaps
the most important one is its flexibility in implementation. ERC-7432 can be implemented in many ways, and for this
reason, the neutral term "lock" is employed. This term can refer to an NFT being frozen (preventing transfers until
roles expire) or deposited in an escrow contract. Developers should decide which implementation to use based on their
use cases.

### Automatic Expiration

Automatic expiration is implemented via the `grantRole` and `roleExpirationDate` functions. `grantRole` is responsible
for setting the expiration date, and `roleExpirationDate` allow developers to check whether the role is expired. Since
`uint256` is not natively supported by most programming languages, dates are represented as `uint64` on this standard.
The maximum UNIX timestamp represented by a `uint64` is about the year `584,942,417,355`, which should be enough to be
considered "permanent". For this reason, it's recommended using `type(uint64).max` to support use cases that require a
role never to expire.

### Revocable Roles

In certain scenarios, the original owner of the NFT may need to revoke a role before its expiration date, while in
others, the recipient may require assurance that the role cannot be revoked. The `revocable` parameter was introduced
to the `grantRole` function to specify whether a role can be revoked prematurely, enabling the standard to
support both use cases.

Regardless of the value of `revocable`, it's recommended always to enable the `recipient` to revoke roles, allowing them
to eliminate undesirable assignments.

### Custom Data

DApps can customize roles using the `data` parameter of the `grantRole` function. `data` is implemented using the
generic type `bytes` to enable dApps to encode any role-specific information when granting a role. The custom
data is retrievable using the `roleData` function and is emitted with the `RoleGranted` event. With this approach, 
developers can integrate this information into their applications, both on-chain and off-chain.

### Role Approval

Similar to [ERC-721](./eip-721.md), this standard enable other accounts to manage roles on behalf of the NFT owner. This
functionality was introduced to allow third-parties to interact with ERC-7432 without requiring NFT ownership. Compliant
contracts MUST implement the functions `setRoleApprovalForAll` and `isRoleApprovedForAll` to deliver this feature. 

## Backwards Compatibility

On all functions and events, the standard requires both the `tokenAddress` and `tokenId` to be provided. This 
requirement enables dApps to use a standalone [ERC-7432](./eip-7432.md) contract as the authoritative source for the
roles of immutable NFTs.

## Reference Implementation

See [ERC-7432.sol](../assets/eip-7432/ERC7432.sol).

## Security Considerations

Developers integrating the Non-Fungible Token Roles interface should consider the following on their implementations:

* Ensure proper access controls are in place to prevent unauthorized role assignments or revocations.
* Take into account potential attack vectors such as reentrancy and ensure appropriate safeguards are in place.
* Approved accounts should be able to manage roles on behalf of another user. However, ensure that the NFT can
  only be transferred to an escrow contract, and back to its original owner (not to the approved account).
* Always check the expiration date before allowing users to access the utility of an NFT.
