# ERC-8055 Specification

This document provides a complete specification of the ERC-8055 standard for non-fungible security tokens. 

## Introduction

ERC-8055 is a standard that expands upon the functionalities of traditional non-fungible tokens, introducing advanced features for managing security and ownership. 

## Authorization Requirements

The following functions have explicit authorization requirements:
- **burn**: Only assigned agents or the contract owner can call this function.
- **remint**: Only assigned agents or the contract owner can call this function.
- **assignAgent**: Only assigned agents or the contract owner can call this function.

## Interface ID

The ERC-165 interface ID for ERC-8055 is 0x6b8b4b5a.

## Contract Interface

```solidity
interface IERC8055 is IERC165 {
    // Function signatures and events definition
}
```

## Events

Events must be properly indexed with `tokenId`, `batchId`, and `agent` indexed to ensure efficient querying.

## Batch Lifecycle Management

Functions to manage the lifecycle of batches:
- `createBatch`
- `finalizeBatch`
- `cancelBatch`

## Remint Semantics

The remint function preserves the `tokenId` and requires the token to be in a burned state before it can be reminted.

## Treasury Management

Generalize treasury management with the following functions:
- `setTreasury`
- `getTreasury`

Both functions will emit a `TreasuryChanged` event.

## ERC-20 Compatibility

Clarify the compatibility with ERC-20 standards to ensure seamless integration.

## Reference Implementation

Add a placeholder for the reference implementation link.

## Branding Removal

All references to GuardianShield and SHIELD branding have been removed from this document.

## Specification Structure

This document includes comprehensive specification, rationale, backwards compatibility, test cases, and copyright sections.
