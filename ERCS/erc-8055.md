status: Draft
type: Standards Track

## Abstract

ERC-8055 introduces a security token implementation with unique serial numbers for each token, burn and remint capabilities for fraud mitigation, batch agent monitoring, and treasury management for unclaimed tokens. It extends ERC-721 with additional security features for digital asset compliance, security, and traceability.

## Motivation

Security tokens require robust tracking, fraud response, and compliance features not present in existing standards. ERC-8055 fills this gap by combining unique identification, agent-based monitoring, and a lifecycle that supports burn/remint for theft, fraud, or contamination. The standard ensures that rightful owners can recover assets and unclaimed tokens are managed responsibly.

## Specification

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.

### Core Interface

```solidity
// ERC-165 interface ID for IERC8055: 0x6b8b4b5a
interface IERC8055 is IERC165, IERC721 {
    // Events
    event TokenBurned(uint256 indexed tokenId, bytes32 indexed reasonCode, string reason, address indexed agent);
    event TokenReminted(uint256 indexed tokenId, address indexed to, address indexed agent, bool returnedToOwner);
    event AgentAssigned(uint256 indexed batchId, address indexed agent);
    event BatchCreated(uint256 indexed batchId, address indexed creator);
    event TreasuryChanged(address indexed previousTreasury, address indexed newTreasury);

    // Core Functions
    function serialNumber(uint256 tokenId) external view returns (bytes32);
    function tokenBatch(uint256 tokenId) external view returns (uint256);
    function batchAgent(uint256 batchId) external view returns (address);
    
    // Burn/Remint Functions (restricted access)
    function burn(uint256 tokenId, bytes32 reasonCode, string calldata reason) external;
    function remint(uint256 tokenId, address to, bool returnedToOwner) external;
    
    // Batch Management (admin only)
    function createBatch() external returns (uint256 batchId);
    function assignAgent(uint256 batchId, address agent) external;
    
    // Treasury Management (admin only)
    function setTreasury(address treasury) external;
    function getTreasury() external view returns (address);
}
```

### Authorization Requirements

The implementation MUST enforce the following access controls:

- Only the assigned agent for a batch or the contract owner (admin) MAY call `burn` and `remint`
- Only the contract owner (admin) MAY call `assignAgent`, `createBatch`, and `setTreasury`
- Unauthorized calls to these functions MUST revert
- Implementations MUST use established patterns such as OpenZeppelin's `AccessControl` roles or equivalent

### Token Properties

- Each ERC-8055 token has a unique serial number (`serialNumber`) returned as `bytes32`
- Tokens are non-fungible and individually tracked
- Tokens are assigned to a batch, each monitored by an agent
- Token batches MUST be created before tokens can be minted into them

### Burn Feature

- Tokens can be burned in the event of theft, fraudulent purchase, or contamination
- Burn events MUST be logged with reason code, reason string, and agent information
- Burned tokens MUST be removed from circulation (ERC-721 `ownerOf` MUST revert)

### Remint Process

- Reminting MUST only be possible for previously burned tokens
- The same `tokenId` MUST be preserved during remint
- If documentation proves rightful ownership, burned tokens are reminted and returned to the owner
- If unclaimed after a defined period, tokens are reminted and transferred to the treasury
- Remint precondition: token MUST have been burned previously

### Batch Management

- Batches MUST be created before tokens can be assigned to them
- Each batch has exactly one assigned agent responsible for monitoring and compliance
- Tokens MUST be associated with a batch upon minting
- Agent assignment can be changed by the admin

### Treasury Management

- Unclaimed tokens are reminted and sent to the configurable treasury address
- Treasury address MUST be configurable by the admin
- Treasury changes MUST emit `TreasuryChanged` event

### ERC-165 Support

Implementations MUST support ERC-165 and return `true` for:
- `0x01ffc9a7` (ERC-165)
- `0x80ac58cd` (ERC-721)
- `0x5b5e139f` (ERC-721 Metadata)
- `0x6b8b4b5a` (ERC-8055)

## Rationale

- Unique serial numbers enable traceability and regulatory compliance
- Burn/remint features mitigate risks associated with digital securities
- Agent oversight introduces accountability for token batches
- Treasury management ensures no assets remain untracked
- Batch system provides scalable monitoring and compliance
- Access control prevents unauthorized manipulation of security tokens

## Backwards Compatibility

ERC-8055 extends ERC-721 and is fully compatible with existing ERC-721 infrastructure. The additional functions and events do not interfere with standard ERC-721 operations.

## Reference Implementation

A reference implementation will be provided at a later date.

## Security Considerations

- Access control is critical - implementations MUST use robust permission systems
- Burn/remint operations should require multi-signature or time-delayed execution for high-value tokens
- Agent private keys should be secured using hardware security modules or equivalent
- Off-chain documentation verification should use cryptographic proofs where possible
- Treasury management should implement additional safeguards for large-scale operations

## Test Cases

- Create batch and assign agent
- Mint token with serial number to batch
- Burn token with reason by authorized agent
- Attempt unauthorized burn (should revert)
- Remint to original owner with documentation
- Remint to treasury after unclaimed period
- Change treasury address (admin only)
- Query batch and agent information
- ERC-165 interface detection
