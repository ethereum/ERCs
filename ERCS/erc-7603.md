## Abstract

The Multi-Asset Token standard, compatible with [ERC-1155](./eip-1155.md), facilitates the development of a new fundamental component: the context-dependent data output for each collection.

The context-dependent data output means that the asset is displayed in an appropriate format based on how the token is accessed. I.e., if the token is being opened in an e-book reader, the PDF asset is displayed; if the token is opened in the marketplace, the PNG or the SVG asset is displayed; if the token is accessed from within a game, the 3D model asset is accessed, and if the token is accessed by an Internet of Things (IoT) hub, the asset providing the necessary addressing and specification information is accessed.

A Token Collection can have multiple assets (outputs), which can be any file to order them by priority. They do not have to match in mime-type or tokenURI, nor do they depend on one another. Assets are not standalone entities but should be considered “namespaced tokenURIs”.

## Motivation

With ERC-1155 compatible tokens being a widespread form of tokens in the Ethereum ecosystem and being used for various use cases, it is time to standardize additional utility for them. Having multiple assets associated with a single Token Collection allows for greater utility, usability, and forward compatibility. This EIP improves upon ERC-1155 in the following areas:

- [Cross-metaverse compatibility](#cross-metaverse-compatibility)
- [Multi-media output](#multi-media-output)
- [Media redundancy](#media-redundancy)

### Cross-metaverse compatibility

The proposal can support any number of different implementations.

Cross-metaverse compatibility could also be referred to as cross-engine compatibility. An example is where a cosmetic item for game A is unavailable in game B because the frameworks are incompatible.

Such Tokens can be given further utility through new assets: more games, cosmetic items, and more.

The following is a more concrete example. One asset is a cosmetic item for game A, a file containing the cosmetic assets. Another is a cosmetic asset file for game B. A third is a generic asset intended to be shown in catalogs, marketplaces, portfolio trackers, or other generalized Token Collection viewers, containing a representation, stylized thumbnail, and animated demo/trailer of the cosmetic item.

This EIP adds a layer of abstraction, allowing game developers to pull asset data from a user's Tokens directly instead of hard-coding it.

### Multi-media output

Tokens of an eBook can be represented as a PDF, MP3, or some other format, depending on what software loads it. If loaded into an eBook reader, a PDF should be displayed, and if loaded into an audiobook application, the MP3 representation should be used. Other metadata could be present in the Tokens (perhaps the book's cover image) for identification on various marketplaces, Search Engine Result Pages (SERPs), or portfolio trackers.

### Media redundancy

Many Tokens are minted hastily without best practices in mind. Specifically, many Tokens are minted with metadata centralized on a server somewhere or, in some cases, a hardcoded IPFS gateway which can also go down, instead of just an IPFS hash.

By adding the same metadata file as different assets, e.g., one asset of metadata and its linked image on Arweave, one asset of this same combination on Sia, another of the same combination on IPFS, etc., the resilience of the metadata and its referenced information increases exponentially as the chances of all the protocols going down at once become less likely.

## Specification

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.

## Rationale

TBD <!-- TODO -->

## Backwards Compatibility

The MultiAsset token standard has been made compatible with ERC-1155 in order to take advantage of the robust tooling available for implementations of ERC-1155 and to ensure compatibility with existing ERC-1155 infrastructure.

## Security Considerations

Needs discussion. <!-- TODO -->
