## Abstract

EIP7849 introduces a new fungible token standard focused on security, efficiency, and interoperability. It extends traditional ERC-20 functionality with built-in gas rebates, secure signature validation using EIP-712, and optimized transfer mechanisms. The standard includes protections against common attack vectors while maintaining full compatibility with existing token interfaces.

## Motivation

Current fungible token standards lack built-in security features and gas optimization mechanisms. EIP7849 addresses these limitations by incorporating:
- Native gas rebate system to reduce transaction costs
- EIP-712 compliant signatures for gasless approvals
- Strong security measures against common vulnerabilities
- Efficient state management and error handling

## Specification

## Token Details

### Core Variables
- `name`: Token name
- `symbol`: Token symbol
- `decimals`: Number of decimal places
- `totalSupply`: Total token supply
- `_balances`: Mapping of address to token balance
- `_allowances`: Mapping of owner address to spender address to allowed amount

### Features
- Gas rebate system
- EIP-712 signature validation
- Nonce tracking for replay protection

## Functions

### View Functions

#### name()
- Returns the token name
- Type: `string`

#### symbol()
- Returns the token symbol
- Type: `string`

#### decimals()
- Returns number of decimals
- Type: `uint8`

#### totalSupply()
- Returns total token supply
- Type: `uint256`

#### balanceOf(address account)
- Returns token balance of specified account
- Type: `uint256`

#### allowance(address owner, address spender)
- Returns remaining allowance for spender
- Type: `uint256`

### State-Changing Functions

#### transfer(address to, uint256 amount)
- Transfers tokens to specified address
- Includes gas rebate processing
- Returns: `bool`

#### approve(address spender, uint256 amount)
- Approves spender to spend tokens
- Returns: `bool`

#### transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 amount)
- Transfers tokens between addresses
- Requires sufficient allowance
- Returns: `bool`

#### permit(address owner, address spender, uint256 value, uint256 deadline, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s)
- Processes gasless approvals using EIP-712 signatures
- Validates signature and deadline
- No return value

### Events

#### Transfer
- Emitted on token transfers
```solidity
event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 value)
```

#### Approval
- Emitted on approval updates
```solidity
event Approval(address indexed owner, address indexed spender, uint256 value)
```

#### GasRebate
- Emitted when gas rebate is processed
```solidity
event GasRebate(address indexed user, uint256 amount)
```

### Gas Rebate System
- Limited to first 10,000 transactions
- Rebate amount = 25% of base transaction cost
- One-time rebate per user
- Requires contract to hold ETH for rebates

### Error Handling
Custom errors for common failure cases:
- `InsufficientBalance`
- `InsufficientAllowance`
- `InvalidSignature`
- `ExpiredDeadline`
- `MaxRebatesReached`
- `TransferToZeroAddress`
- `ApproveToZeroAddress`

## Rationale

The design choices in EIP7849 prioritize:
1. Security through custom error handling and signature validation
2. Gas efficiency via rebate mechanisms
3. Interoperability through standard EIP-712 implementation
4. User experience through gasless approvals

## Backwards Compatibility

EIP7849 maintains full backwards compatibility with ERC-20 while adding enhanced functionality.

## Security Considerations

- Implements nonce tracking for signature validation
- Uses custom errors for efficient error handling
- Includes checks against zero-address transfers
- Limits gas rebates to prevent abuse
- Validates EIP-712 signatures for permit operations
