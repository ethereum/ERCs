## Abstract
This proposal builds off of [ERC-7930] (Interoperable Addresses & Names) to provide a standard and human-readable format for chain-specific addresses which provides:
- A unified format for accounts that specifies, together with the address, the chain where the address lives.
- The use of human-readable chain names and how they can be resolved to chain identifiers.
- The use of human-readable account names and how they can be resolved to addresses.
- A centralized index of chain and account resolution methods, way smaller in scope than ethereum-lists/chains

## Motivation
The current Ethereum address landscape is leading to an ecosystem that will have hundreds and eventually thousands of L2s that use the same address format as Ethereum mainnet. This means an address by itself is not enough information to know which chain the address is related to. This can be problematic if funds are sent to an unreachable address on the incorrect chain. From the user account it should be possible to obtain the right chain identifier (chainID) to include in a transaction. 

The mapping from chain names to identifiers has, since [EIP-155](./eip-155.md), been maintained off chain using a centralized list. This solution has a few shortcomings:
- It does not scale with the growing number of L2s.
- The list maintainer is a trusted centralized entity.
- It does not (currently) support non-EVM chains, even when naming systems (such as ENS, since ENSIP-9) do.

Instead of using chain identifiers, which are not human readable, the address could be extended with a human-readable chain name, which can then be resolved to a chain identifier.
The mapping from chain names to identifiers can be resolved via a variety of methods which are coupled to the name's TLD.

In the same spirit, the address could be a human-readable name as well, which is already a use case for ENS. By coupling the TLD to the resolving method used, this standard could leverage current and future features of ENS as well as other naming registries.

Moreover, the above can be leveraged to allow for a name to represent the same entity corresponding to different addresses on different chains, mitigating the risk of sending funds to an address the intended recipient doesn't actually control.

Desired properties:
- Backwards compatibility with [ERC-7930]
- The chain portion can be an [ERC-7785] domain name when that standard is productive, or use solutions similar to ethereum-lists/chains in the immediate future.
- The address portion can be either the appropriate type of address for the chain, or a domain name.
- The address portion and the chain portion should be resolved separately.

## Specification
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.

### Format
This standard defines a sub-syntax with extra semantics on top of the Interoperable Names syntax defined in [ERC-7930].

```
<human readable name>: := <address> "@" <chain> "#" <checksum>
<address>:             := <raw-address> | <ens-name>
<chain>:               := <raw-address> | <shortname> | <ens-name>
<checksum>:            := [0-9A-F]{8}

<raw-address>:         := [-:_%a-zA-Z0-9]+
<raw-chain>:           := [-:_a-zA-Z0-9]+
<shortname>:           := [-_a-zA-Z0-9]+
<ens-name>:            := (<label> .)+ <label>
```

> [!NOTE]
> while shortnames are _intended_ to be short, there's no length restriction placed on them as there are some shortnames already registered on ethereum-lists/chains with up to 38 characters

Where:

- `<raw-chain>`, `<raw-address>` and `<checksum>` are defined to maintain backwards compatibility with [ERC-7930], and their semantics remain the same.
- `<shortname>`: Corresponds to an entry in the centralized chain list hosted on the ethereum-lists/chains github repository.
- `<ens-name>`: An ENS name, which should be resolved following the appropiate ENSIPs (which this standard does not aim to overwrite). It's grammar definition is slightly different than that of ENSIP-1, as this standard does not support names consisting of only a TLD, since they'd be of limited usefulness and impossible to tell apart from shortnames
- `<label>`: Any valid string label per UTS46, as defined in ENSIP-1.

This allows for Interoperable Addresses' text representation to mix and match 'resolved' and 'unresolved' usages in both the chain and address parts.

A few examples below:
```
Mainnet
- 0x12345...6789@eip155:1#FFFFFFFF
- 0x12345...6789@eth#FFFFFFFF
- alice.eth@eth#FFFFFFFF

Testnet (Sepolia)
- 0x12345...6789@eip155:11155111#00000000
- alice.testeth@sep#00000000

Rollup
- 0x12345...6789@eip155:4270#AAAAAAAA
- 0x12345...6789@arb-nova#AAAAAAAA
- alice.eth@arb-nova#AAAAAAAA

Assuming ERC-7785 starts listing chains at l2.eth
- alice.eth@arb-nova.l2.eth#AAAAAAAA

My ENS name is registered on rollup1 (via ENSIP-10 & ENSIP-16), but I want to receive funds on rollup2
- alice.rollup1.eth@rollup2#BBBBBBBB

Non-evm chain
- bc1..23@bip122:000000000019d6689c085ae165831e93#CCCCCCCC
- alice.eth@bip122:000000000019d6689c085ae165831e93#CCCCCCCC

Assuming the shortname list adds a few other CAIP namespaces
- alice.eth@btc#CCCCCCCC
```

> [!NOTE]
> This standard does not explicitly define a hierarchical name structure for anything other than the top level domain, inheriting that property in the general case from ENS, as shown in the ENS-in-rollup example.

### Checksum
Addresses must be serialized to the `ChainType, ChainReferenceLength, ChainReference, AddressLength, Address` format proposed in [ERC-7930] as Interoperable Addresses v1, and the 4-byte checksum MUST be displayed as part of the address as described in the syntax above.

This ensures that the checksum changes if any part of the address or chain ID is modified, turning dangerous manual edits into detectable errors for wallet users.

### Resolving chain names

The algorithm for naming chains is different depending on whether the chain part of the Interoperable Name corresponds to an ENS name or a shortname.

#### shortname
Names without a dot `.` in them are interpreted as entries in the ethereum-lists/chains github repository.

To obtain the name to use to display a chain, wallets should:
- open the file under `_data/chains/${CAIP-2 namespace}-${CAIP-2 reference}.json`
- use its `shortname` field.

Wallets are advised to maintain an index to perform the reverse lookup on that directory, since it does not provide a way to search for a shortname's chainid without reading all files under `_data/chains`.

#### Supported CASA namespaces
While currently only `eip155` chains are supported, the repository could start listing other chains in order to make human-readable names for non-evm chains possible.

#### ENS chain names
Hierarchical names (e.g. anything containing a dot `.`) are reserved for a future standard to define chain-name resolution with ENS.

#### Supported CASA namespaces
Can't be defined at this point

### Resolving address names
The entirety of address name resolving of all TLDs is delegated to ENS, as specified in current & future ENSIPs.

Some caveats for ENS support are:
- For addresses on chains that are both supported by SLIP-0044 and the special scheme for the eip155 namespace defined in ENSIP-11, the latter should be used.
<!-- TODO: find a few more edge cases or get rid of the ul -->

#### Supported CASA namespaces
Forward resolution (Interoperable Address -> Interoperable Name): `eip155` (via ENSIP-11) and anything supported by SLIP-0044, as defined in ENSIP-9.

Reverse resolution (Interoperable Name -> Interoperable Address): `eip155` chains explicitly supported by ENS by deployment of `L2ReverseRegistrar` on them and registration of that contract's address on the ENS registry.

### Forward resolution step-by-step example
This section is non-normative, as future ENSIPs can modify the way in which ENS is used.

1. Let the user input an address name. Assume it's `alice.eth`.
2. Let the user select a chain. Assume it's `oeth`. This does not have to be a bare text input, with wallets being able to define whatever UX they consider more intuitive.
3. Parse the result from the step above to know if it corresponds to a hierarchical name or a chain list entry.
4. Look up the result from the step above on the centralized chain list. In this case, the repository says it corresponds to:
    - chain namespace: `eip155`
    - chain reference: `10` (chainid of OP Mainnet)
5. As per ENSIP-11, convert the eip155 chainid into an ENSIP-11-specific `coinType`: `0x80000000 & 0x0000000A == 0x8000000A`.
6. Compute the namehash of the result of step 1, according to ENSIP-1.
7. Query the ENS registry for the appropriate resolver by calling `resolver(bytes32 node)` with the result of the step above.
8. Call `addr(bytes32 node, uint256 coinType)` on the contract returned on the step above with the results of steps 6 and 5, respectively. This will return the 20 bytes of alice's OP Mainnet address, assume it's `0xaAaAaAaaAaAaAaaAaAAAAAAAAaaaAaAaAaaAaaAa`
    - Failure mode: if result is address zero, that means the name is not registered and resolution can't be finished.
9. Serialize `ChainType`, `ChainReferenceLength`, `ChainReference`, `AddressLength` and `Address` according to [ERC-7930] (Interoperable Address v1): `[ 0002 0000 01 0A 14 AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA ]`
10. Interoperable Address is complete: `0x00020000010A14AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA`
11. Compute the checksum as described in [ERC-7930]: `0xC69BEB13` and display it to the user.

### Reverse Resolution step-by-step example
Starting from the Interoperable Address serialized above: `0x00010000010A14AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA`

1. Pick the first two bytes corresponding to the version: `0x0001`. Remaining payload: `0000010A14AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA00010002`
2. Parse the `ChainType`, `ChainReferenceLength`, `ChainReference`, `AddressLength` and `Address` according to [ERC-7930]. Remaining payload `00010002`
    1. `ChainType`: `0x0000` -> `eip155`
    2. `ChainReferenceLength`: `0x01` -> 1
    3. `ChainReference`: `0x0A` -> 10 (OP Mainnet)
    4. `AddressLength`: `0x14` -> 20 bytes, consistent with `eip155`
    4. `Address`: `0xaAaAaAaaAaAaAaaAaAAAAAAAAaaaAaAaAaaAaaAa` -> alice's address
3. Since ENS did not yet define a way to name chains, unconditionally look up the chain namespace & reference on the centralized list.
4. Via CAIP-350, look up the text representation of `ChainType 0x0000`: `eip155`
5. Via CAIP-350, look up the text representation of `ChainReference 0x0A`: `10`, represented in base 10.
6. Look up the `_data/${3}-{4}.json` on the centralized list, and obtain the `.shortname` attribute: `oeth`.
7. Compute `coinTypeAsHex` for ENSIP-19:
    - Check if `ChainType == 0x0000`, as ENSIP-19 does not support non-EVM chains.
    - Check if `ChainReference & 0xFFFFFFFF == ChainReference`, meaning, all 28 most significant bytes are zero. If this is not the case, fail resolution as ENSIP-19 does not support chainids larger than 4 bytes.
    - Truncate the `ChainReference` to its 4 least significant bytes: `0x000000A`
    - Set the `ChainReference`'s MSB to 1: `0x000000A | 0x8000000`: `0x8000000A`
    - Convert to a lowercase-hexadecimal string without `0x` prefix: `8000000a`
8. Compute the address as ENSIP-19 expects it, by producing the lowercase-hexadecimal string without `0x` prefix of `Address`: `aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa`
9. Convert the output from two steps above to a reverse lookup string of the form `<address>.<coinType>.reverse` for ENSIP-19: `aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.8000000a.reverse`
10. Find resolver to use for address according to ENS wildcard resolution.
    1. Call `resolver(namehash(aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.8000000a.reverse))` on the mainnet ENS registry. It'll return the zero address, since there is no resolver registered on that address specifically.
    2. Call `resolver(namehash(8000000a.reverse))` on the mainnet ENS registry. It'll return `0x00000beef055f7934784d6d81b6bc86665630dba`, the address of the `L2ReverseRegistrar` *on the network with chainid 10*.
11. Verify the return of the `coinType` method of the `L2ReverseRegistrar` matches the coinType as serialized in step 7.
<!-- TODO: does this perform a CCIP read and queries the mainnet ENS registry? if so, should we document it in this example? -->
12. Call `nameForAddr(bytes address)` with the address as serialized in step 8. This will return the human-readable name `alice.eth`.
13. Check forward resolution of the name as described in ENSIP-11 and repeated in the section above.
    - If it resolves to the same address, then proceed normally.
    - If it resolves to a different address, including an empty bytes array, display the [ERC-7930]-style unresolved address and optionally show a warning to the user.
14. Compute the checksum as described in [ERC-7930]: `0xC69BEB13`.
15. Format the address in the format `<address>@<chain>#<checksum>` and display it to the user: `alice.eth@oeth#C69BEB13`

## Rationale
- Using ENS as the only resolving method means it's enough to use the same Interoperable Addresses v1 for this standard, without extending it to also store the name resolver used. This means however that wallets are free to show users both resolved and unresolved (raw) Interoperable Names.
- Explicitly reserving a place in the syntax of the Interoperable Name for a planned on-chain chain naming standard ensures forward compatibility.

## Open Discussions
- Further constrain the syntax of human-readable names to minimize:
    - Collisions on names by e.g. UTS46 case folding
    - Addresses that are valid ERC-7828 but cant be squeezed into ENS or comparable standards
- Conflicts with existing standards:
    - ENSIP-11 defines the bitmask to use for `eip155` `coinType` assuming chainids are 31 bits or shorter, which is in conflict with [ERC-7785] and the addresses representable in [ERC-7930].

## Backwards Compatibility
The naming scheme herein defined can represent all names supported by [ERC-7930] by displaying raw addresses without resolution

## Security Considerations
- Wallet developers should be aware of possible unicode glyph collisions in resolved names and warn users about them in order to keep checksums effective, since an attacker could, in order to impersonate `alice.eth@chain.short#00112233`:
    - Mine an address on `chain.short` such that the checksum of the Interoperable Address is `00112233`.
    - Register `аlice.eth` (using the russian vowel `а` instead of the latin `a`), and point it to the address above.
- ENSIP-19 introduces trust assumptions when resolving reverse records offchain:
    - ZK-rollups may offer trust-minimized resolution via onchain proofs.
    - Sidechains may rely on centralized CCIP-read gateways or signature authorities.

    Wallets MUST surface whether reverse resolution was trust-minimized or trusted.
