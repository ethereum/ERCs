## Abstract

A set of functions to enable meta-transactions and atomic interactions with contracts implementing an operator model, via signatures conforming to the [EIP-712](./eip-712.md) typed message signing specification.

## Motivation

The primary motivation for this standard is to enhance the flexibility, security, and efficiency of operator management. By leveraging EIP-712 signatures, this standard allows users to authorize operators without the need for on-chain transactions, reducing gas costs and improving user experience. This is particularly beneficial whenever frequent operator changes and cross-chain interactions are required.

Additionally, this standard aims to:

1. **Enable Meta-Transactions**: Allow users to delegate the execution of transactions to operators, enabling meta-transactions where the user does not need to hold native tokens to pay for gas fees on each chain.
2. **Improve Security**: Utilize the EIP-712 standard for typed data signing, which provides a more secure and user-friendly way to sign messages compared to raw data signing.
3. **Facilitate Interoperability**: Provide a standardized interface for operator management that can be adopted across various vault protocols, promoting interoperability and reducing integration complexity for developers.
4. **Streamline Cross-Chain Operations**: Simplify the process of managing operators across different chains, making it easier for protocols to maintain consistent operator permissions and interactions in a multi-chain environment.

By addressing these needs, the `Authorize Operator` standard aims to streamline the process of managing operators in decentralized vault protocols, making it easier for users and developers to interact with smart contracts in a secure, cost-effective, and interoperable manner across multiple blockchain networks.

## Specification

### Operator-compatible contracts

This signed authorization scheme applies to any contracts implementing the following interface:

```solidity
  interface IOperator {
    event OperatorSet(address indexed owner, address indexed operator, bool approved);

    function setOperator(address operator, bool approved) external returns (bool);
    function isOperator(address owner, address operator) external returns (bool status);
  }
```

[EIP-6909](./eip-6909.md) and [EIP-7540](./eip-7540.md) already implement this interface.

The naming of the arguments is interchangeable, e.g. [EIP-6909](./eip-6909.md) uses `spender` instead of `operator`.

### Methods

#### `authorizeOperator`

Grants or revokes permissions for `operator` to manage Requests on behalf of the `msg.sender`, using an [EIP-712](./eip-712.md) signature.

MUST revert if the `deadline` has passed.

MUST invalidate the nonce of the signature to prevent message replay.

MUST revert if the `signature` is not a valid [EIP-712](./eip-712.md) signature, with the given input parameters.

MUST set the operator status to the `approved` value.

MUST log the `OperatorSet` event.

MUST return `true`.

```yaml
- name: authorizeOperator
  type: function
  stateMutability: nonpayable

  inputs:
    - name: owner
      type: address
    - name: operator
      type: address
    - name: approved
      type: bool
    - name: deadline
      type: uint256
    - name: nonce
      type: bytes32
    - name: signature
      type: bytes

  outputs:
    - name: success
      type: bool
```

#### `invalidateNonce`

Revokes the given `nonce` for `msg.sender` as the `owner`.

```yaml
- name: invalidateNonce
  type: function
  stateMutability: nonpayable

  inputs:
    - name: nonce
      type: bytes32
```

#### `authorizations`

Returns whether the given `nonce` has been used for the `controller`.

```yaml
- name: authorizations
  type: function
  stateMutability: nonpayable

  inputs:
    - name: controller
      type: address
    - name: nonce
      type: bytes32
  outputs:
    - name: used
      type: bool
```

#### `DOMAIN_SEPARATOR`

Returns the `DOMAIN_SEPARATOR` as defined according to EIP-712. The `DOMAIN_SEPARATOR` should be unique to the contract and chain to prevent replay attacks from other domains, and satisfy the requirements of EIP-712, but is otherwise unconstrained.

```yaml
- name: DOMAIN_SEPARATOR
  type: function
  stateMutability: nonpayable

  outputs:
    - type: bytes32
```

### [ERC-165](./eip-165.md) support

Smart contracts implementing this standard MUST implement the [ERC-165](./eip-165.md) `supportsInterface` function.

Contracts MUST return the constant value `true` if `0x7a7911eb` is passed through the `interfaceID` argument.

## Rationale

### Similarity to [ERC-2612](./eip-2612.md)

The specification is intentionally designed to closely match [ERC-2612](./eip-2612.md). This should simplify new integrations of the standard.

The main difference is using `bytes32` vs `uint256`, which enables unordered nonces. 

## Reference Implementation

```solidity
    // This code snippet is incomplete pseudocode used for example only and is no way intended to be used in production or guaranteed to be secure

    bytes32 public constant AUTHORIZE_OPERATOR_TYPEHASH =
        keccak256("AuthorizeOperator(address controller,address operator,bool approved,uint256 deadline,bytes32 nonce)");

    mapping(address owner => mapping(bytes32 nonce => bool used)) authorizations;

    function DOMAIN_SEPARATOR() public view returns (bytes32) {
      // EIP-712 implementation 
    }

    function isValidSignature(address signer, bytes32 digest, bytes memory signature) internal view returns (bool valid) {
      // ERC-1271 implementation 
    }

    function authorizeOperator(
        address controller,
        address operator,
        bool approved,
        uint256 deadline,
        bytes32 nonce,
        bytes memory signature
    ) external returns (bool success) {
        require(block.timestamp <= deadline, "ERC7540Vault/expired");
        require(controller != address(0), "ERC7540Vault/invalid-controller");
        require(!authorizations[controller][nonce], "ERC7540Vault/authorization-used");

        authorizations[controller][nonce] = true;

        bytes32 digest = keccak256(
            abi.encodePacked(
                "\x19\x01",
                DOMAIN_SEPARATOR(),
                keccak256(abi.encode(AUTHORIZE_OPERATOR_TYPEHASH, controller, operator, approved, deadline, nonce))
            )
        );

        require(SignatureLib.isValidSignature(controller, digest, signature), "ERC7540Vault/invalid-authorization");

        isOperator[controller][operator] = approved;
        emit OperatorSet(controller, operator, approved);

        success = true;
    }
    
    function invalidateNonce(bytes32 nonce) external {
        authorizations[msg.sender][nonce] = true;
    }
```

## Security Considerations

Operators have significant control over users and the signed message can lead to undesired outcomes. The expiration date should be set as short as feasible to reduce the chance of an unused signature leaking at a later point.
