## Abstract

The verifiable AI-generated content (AIGC) non-fungible token (NFT) standard is an extension of the [ERC-721](./eip-721.md) token standard for AIGC. It proposes a set of interfaces for basic interactions and enumerable interactions for AIGC-NFTs. The standard includes an `addAigcData` and `verify` function interface, a new `AigcData` event, optional `Enumerable` and `Updatable` extensions, and a JSON schema for AIGC-NFT metadata. Additionally, it incorporates Zero-Knowledge Machine Learning (zkML) and Optimistic Machine Learning (opML) capabilities to enable verification of AIGC data correctness. In this standard, the `tokenId` is indexed by the `prompt`.

## Motivation

The verifiable AIGC-NFT standard aims to extend the existing [ERC-721](./eip-721.md) token standard to accommodate the unique requirements of AI-generated content NFTs representing models in a collection. This standard provides interfaces to use zkML or opML to verify whether or not the AIGC data for an NFT is generated from a certain ML model with a certain input (prompt). The proposed interfaces allow for additional functionality related to adding AIGC data, verifying, and enumerating AIGC-NFTs. Additionally, the metadata schema provides a structured format for storing information related to AIGC-NFTs, such as the prompt used to generate the content and the proof of ownership.

This standard supports two primary types of proofs: validity proofs and fraud proofs. In practice, zkML and opML are commonly employed as the prevailing instances for these types of proofs. Developers can choose their preferred ones.

In the zkML scenario, this standard enables model owners to publish their trained model and its ZKP verifier to Ethereum. Any user can claim an input (prompt) and publish the inference task. Any node that maintains the model and the proving circuit can perform the inference and proving, and submit the output of inference and the ZK proof for the inference trace to the verifier. The user that initiates the inference task will own the output for the inference of that model and input (prompt).

In the opML scenario, this standard enables model owners to publish their trained model to Ethereum. Any user can claim an input (prompt) and publish the inference task. Any node that maintains the model can perform the inference and submit the inference output. Other nodes can challenge this result within a predefined challenge period. At the end of the challenge period, the user can verify that they own the output for the inference of that model and prompt, and update the AIGC data as needed.

This capability is especially beneficial for AI model authors and AI content creators seeking to capitalize on their creations. With this standard, every input prompt and its resulting content can be securely verified on the blockchain. This opens up opportunities for implementing revenue-sharing mechanisms for all AI-generated content (AIGC) NFT sales. AI model authors can now share their models without concerns that open-sourcing will diminish their financial value.

An example workflow of a zkML AIGC NFT project compliant with this proposal is as follows:

![zkML Suggested Workflow](../assets/eip-7007/workflow.png)

There are 4 components in this workflow:

- ML model - contains weights of a pre-trained model; given an inference input, generates the output
- zkML prover - given an inference task with input and output, generates a ZK proof
- AIGC-NFT smart contract - contract compliant with this proposal, with full [ERC-721](./eip-721.md) functionalities
- Verifier smart contract - implements a `verify` function, given an inference task and its ZK proof, returns the verification result as a boolean

## Specification

The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.

**Every compliant contract must implement the `IERC7007`, [`ERC721`](./eip-721.md), and [`ERC165`](./eip-165.md) interfaces.**

The verifiable AIGC-NFT standard includes the following interfaces:

`IERC7007`: Defines an `addAigcData` function and an `AigcData` event for adding AIGC data to AIGC-NFTs. Defines a `verify` function to check the validity of the combination of prompt and aigcData using zkML/opML techniques.

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.18;

/**
 * @dev Required interface of an ERC7007 compliant contract.
 * Note: the ERC-165 identifier for this interface is 0x702c55a6.
 */
interface IERC7007 is IERC165, IERC721 {
    /**
     * @dev Emitted when `tokenId` token's AIGC data is added.
     */
    event AigcData(
        uint256 indexed tokenId,
        bytes indexed prompt,
        bytes indexed aigcData,
        bytes proof
    );

    /**
     * @dev Add AIGC data to token at `tokenId` given `prompt`, `aigcData`, and `proof`.
     */
    function addAigcData(
        uint256 tokenId,
        bytes calldata prompt,
        bytes calldata aigcData,
        bytes calldata proof
    ) external;

    /**
     * @dev Verify the `prompt`, `aigcData`, and `proof`.
     */
    function verify(
        bytes calldata prompt,
        bytes calldata aigcData,
        bytes calldata proof
    ) external view returns (bool success);
}
```

### Optional Extension: Enumerable

The **enumeration extension** is OPTIONAL for [ERC-7007](./eip-7007.md) smart contracts. This allows your contract to publish its full list of mapping between `tokenId` and `prompt` and make them discoverable.

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.18;

/**
 * @title ERC7007 Token Standard, optional enumeration extension
 * Note: the ERC-165 identifier for this interface is 0xfa1a557a.
 */
interface IERC7007Enumerable is IERC7007 {
    /**
     * @dev Returns the token ID given `prompt`.
     */
    function tokenId(bytes calldata prompt) external view returns (uint256);

    /**
     * @dev Returns the prompt given `tokenId`.
     */
    function prompt(uint256 tokenId) external view returns (string calldata);
}
```

### Optional Extension: Updatable

The **updatable extension** is OPTIONAL for [ERC-7007](./eip-7007.md) smart contracts. This allows your contract to update a token's `aigcData` in the case of opML, where `aigcData` content might change over the challenge period.

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.18;

/**
 * @title ERC7007 Token Standard, optional updatable extension
 * Note: the ERC-165 identifier for this interface is 0x3f37dce2.
 */
interface IERC7007Updatable is IERC7007 {
    /**
     * @dev Update the `aigcData` of `prompt`.
     */
    function update(
        bytes calldata prompt,
        bytes calldata aigcData
    ) external;

    /**
     * @dev Emitted when `tokenId` token is updated.
     */
    event Update(
        uint256 indexed tokenId,
        bytes indexed prompt,
        bytes indexed aigcData
    );
}
```

      "type": "string",
      "description": "validity (zkML) or fraud (opML)"
    }
  }
}
```

### ML Model Publication

While this standard does not describe the Machine Learning model publication stage, it is natural and recommended to publish the commitment of the Model to Ethereum separately, before any actual `addAigcData` actions. The model commitment schema choice lies on the AIGC-NFT project issuer party. The commitment should be checked inside the implementation of the `verify` function.

## Rationale

### Unique Token Identification

This specification sets the `tokenId` to be the hash of its corresponding `prompt`, creating a deterministic and collision-resistant way to associate tokens with their unique content generation parameters. This design decision ensures that the same prompt (which corresponds to the same AI-generated content under the same model seed) cannot be minted more than once, thereby preventing duplication and preserving the uniqueness of each NFT within the ecosystem.

### Generalization to Different Proof Types

This specification accommodates two proof types: validity proofs for zkML and fraud proofs for opML. Function arguments in `addAigcData` and `verify` are designed for generality, allowing for compatibility with both proof systems. Moreover, the specification includes an updatable extension that specifically serves the requirements of opML.

### `verify` interface

We specify a `verify` interface to enforce the correctness of `aigcData`. It is defined as a view function to reduce gas cost. `verify` should return true if and only if `aigcData` is finalized in both zkML and opML. In zkML, it must verify the ZK proof, i.e. `proof`; in opML, it must make sure that the challenging period is finalized, and that the `aigcData` is up-to-date, i.e. has been updated after finalization. Additionally, `proof` can be _empty_ in opML.

### `addAigcData` interface

We specify an `addAigcData` interface to bind the prompt and `aigcData` with `tokenId`. This function provides flexibility for different minting implementations. Notably, it acts differently in zkML and opML cases. In zkML, `addAigcData` should make sure `verify` returns `true`. While in opML, it can be called before finalization. The consideration here is that, limited by the proving difficulty, zkML usually targets simple model inference tasks in practice, making it possible to provide a proof within an acceptable time frame. On the other hand, opML enables large model inference tasks, with a cost of longer confirmation time to achieve the approximate same security level. Mint until opML finalization may not be the best practice considering the existing optimistic protocols.

### Naming Choice on `update`

We adopt "update" over "finalize" because a successful challenge happens rarely in practice. Using `update` could avoid calling it for every `tokenId` and save gas.

## Backwards Compatibility

This standard is backward compatible with the [ERC-721](./eip-721.md) as it extends the existing functionality with new interfaces.

## Test Cases

The reference implementation includes sample implementations of the [ERC-7007](./eip-7007.md) interfaces under `contracts/` and corresponding unit tests under `test/`. This repo can be used to test the functionality of the proposed interfaces and metadata schema.

## Reference Implementation

- ERC-7007 for [zkML](../assets/eip-7007/contracts/ERC7007Zkml.sol) and [opML](../assets/eip-7007/contracts/ERC7007Opml.sol)
- [ERC-7007 Enumerable Extension](../assets/eip-7007/contracts/ERC7007Enumerable.sol)

## Security Considerations

### Frontrunning Risk

To address the risk of frontrunning, where an actor could potentially observe and preemptively claim a prompt during the minting process, implementers of this proposal must incorporate a secure prompt-claiming mechanism. Implementations could include time-locks, commit-reveal schemes, or other anti-frontrunning techniques to ensure equitable and secured claim processes for AIGC-NFTs.

### AIGC Data Change During Challenge Period

In the opML scenario, it is important to consider that the `aigcData` might change during the challenge period due to disputes or updates. The updatable extension defined here provides a way to handle these updates. Implementations must ensure that updates to `aigcData` are treated as critical state changes that require adherence to the same security and validation protocols as the initial minting process. Indexers should always check for any `Update` event emission.
