## **Abstract**

This proposal introduces an extension for [ERC-721](./eip-721.md) Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs): specifying users for several contexts and differentiating owner and ownership rights for a token to use in several financial use cases for NFT without changing owner.

## Motivation

For a standard [ERC-721](./eip-721.md) NFT, there are some use cases of financial applications including:

- Granting users for difference purposes like rental or delegation.
- Staking NFTs for earning rewards.
- Mortgaging an NFT to generate income.

Traditionally, these applications require ownership transfers to lock NFT in contracts. However, other decentralized applications (dApps) recognize token ownership as proof that the token owner is entitled to benefits within the rewarding systems, such as airdrops or tiered rewards. If token owners get their tokens locked in contracts they are not eligible to receive benefits from holding tokens, or the reward systems have to support as many contracts as possible to help these owners.

It is because there is only an Owner role indicating the ownership rights, developing on top of [ERC-721](./eip-721.md) has often posed challenges. This proposal aims to solve these challenges by: contextualizing the use case to be handled by controllers, and distinguishing ownership rights from other roles at the standard level through delegation mechanism. Standardizing these measures, dApp developers can more easily construct infrastructure and protocols on top of this standard.

## Specification

The keywords “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

### Definitions

This specification encompasses the following components:

**Token Context** provides a specified use case of a token. It serves as the association relationship between Tokens and Contexts. Within each unique token context, there exists an allocated user who is authorized to utilize the token within that context. In a specified context there are two distinct roles:

- **Controller**: This role possesses the authority to control the context.
- **User**: This role signifies the primary token user within the given context.

**Ownership Rights** of a token are defined to be able to:

- Transfer that token to a new owner.
- Add token context(s): attaching that token to/from 1 or many contexts.
- Remove token context(s): detaching that token to/from 1 or many contexts.

**Ownership Delegation** involves distinguishing between owner and ownership rights by delegating ownership to other accounts for a specific duration. During this period, owners temporarily cede ownership rights until the delegation expires.

### Roles

| Roles               | Explanation / Permission                                                                                                                                | Quantity per Token |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Owner               | • Has **Ownership Rights** by default<br>• Delegates an account to hold **Ownership Rights** in a duration                                              | $1$                |
| Ownership Delegatee | • Has **Ownership Rights** in a delegation duration<br>• Renounces before delegation expires                                                            | $1$                |
| Ownership Manager   | • Is one who holds **Ownership Rights**<br>• If not delegated yet, it is referenced to **Owner**, otherwise it is referenced to **Ownership Delegatee** | $1$                |
| **Context Roles**   |                                                                                                                                                         | $n$                |
| Controller          | • Transfers controller<br>• Sets context user<br>• (Un)locks token transfer                                                                             | $1$ per context    |
| User                | • Authorized to use token in its context                                                                                                                | $1$ per context    |

### Interface

**Smart contracts implementing this standard MUST implement all of the functions in the `IERC7695` interface.**

Smart contracts implementing this standard MUST implement the [ERC-165](./eip-165.md) `supportsInterface` function and MUST return the constant value `true` if `0xba63ebbb` is passed through the `interfaceID` argument.

```

**Enumerable extension**

The enumeration extension is OPTIONAL for this standard. This allows your contract to publish its full list of context and make it discoverable. When calling the `supportsInterface` function MUST return the constant value `true` if `0xcebf44b7` is passed through the `interfaceID` argument.

```solidity
/// Note: the ERC-165 identifier for this interface is 0xcebf44b7.
interface IERC7695Enumerable /* is IERC165 */ {
  /// @dev Returns a created context in this contract at `index`.
  /// An index must be a value between 0 and {getContextCount}, non-inclusive.
  /// Note: When using {getContext} and {getContextCount}, make sure you perform all queries on the same block.
  function getContext(uint256 index) external view returns(bytes32 ctxHash);

  /// @dev Returns the number of contexts created in the contract.
  function getContextCount() external view returns(uint256);

  /// @dev Returns a context attached with a token at `index`.
  /// An index must be a value between 0 and {getAttachedContextCount}, non-inclusive.
  /// Note: When using {getAttachedContext} and {getAttachedContextCount}, make sure you perform all queries on the same block.
  function getAttachedContext(uint256 tokenId, uint256 index) external view returns(bytes32 ctxHash);

  /// @dev Returns the number of contexts attached with the token.
  function getAttachedContextCount(uint256 tokenId) external view returns(uint256);
}
```

**Controller Interface**

The controller is RECOMMENDED to be a contract and includes methods to be invoked in cases there are any attach or detach requests. When calling the `supportsInterface` function MUST return the constant value `true` if `0x92625f0b` is passed through the `interfaceID` argument.

```solidity
/// Note: the ERC-165 identifier for this interface is 0x92625f0b.
interface IERC7695ContextCallback /* is IERC165 */  {
  /// @dev This method is called once the token is attached by any mechanism.
  /// @param ctxHash  The hash of context invoked this call.
  /// @param tokenId  NFT identifier which is being attached.
  /// @param operator The address which called {attachContext} function.
  /// @param data     Additional data with no specified format.
  function onAttached(bytes32 ctxHash, uint256 tokenId, address operator, bytes calldata data) external;

  /// @dev This method is called once the token detachment is requested by any mechanism.
  /// @param ctxHash  The hash of context invoked this call.
  /// @param tokenId  NFT identifier which is being requested for detachment.
  /// @param operator The address which called {requestDetachContext} function.
  /// @param data     Additional data with no specified format.
  function onDetachRequested(bytes32 ctxHash, uint256 tokenId, address operator, bytes calldata data) external;

  /// @dev This method is called once a token context is detached by any mechanism.
  /// @param ctxHash  The hash of context invoked this call.
  /// @param tokenId  NFT identifier which is being detached.
  /// @param operator The address which called {execDetachContext} function.
  /// @param data     Additional data with no specified format.
  function onExecDetachContext(bytes32 ctxHash, uint256 tokenId, address operator, bytes calldata data) external;
}
```

### Ownership Delegation Rules

**startDelegateOwnership rules**

- MUST revert unless there is no delegation.
- MUST revert unless the caller is the owner or approved accounts to manage the tokens for owner (via `approve` or `setApprovalForAll` function).
- MUST revert unless the expiry time is in the future.
- MUST revert if the delegatee address is the owner or zero address.
- MUST revert if the token is not existent.
- MUST emit the event `OwnershipDelegationStarted` on success.
- After the above conditions are met, this function MUST replace the pending delegation if any.

**acceptOwnershipDelegation rules**

- MUST revert if there is no delegation for this delegatee.
- MUST revert unless the caller is the delegatee or approved accounts to manage the tokens for delegatee (via `setApprovalForAll` function).
- MUST revert unless the expiry time is in the future.
- MUST revert if the token is not existent.
- MUST emit the event `OwnershipDelegationAccepted` on success.

**stopDelegateOwnership rules**

- MUST revert if there is no delegation for this delegatee.
- MUST revert unless the caller is the delegatee or approved accounts to manage the tokens for delegatee (via`setApprovalForAll` function).
- MUST revert unless the expiry time is in the future.

### **Token (Un)lock Rules**

To be more explicit about how token (un)locked, these functions:

- The `setContextLock` function MUST be called by the controller to (un)lock
- The `requestDetachContext` and `execDetachContext` functions MUST be called by the ownership manager and MUST operate with respect to the `IERC7695ContextCallback` hook functions.

A list of scenarios and rules follows.

**Scenarios**

**_Scenario#1:_** Context controller wants to lock a token that is not requested for detachment.

- `setContextLock` MUST be called successfully

**_Scenario#2:_** Context controller wants to lock a token that is requested for detachment.

- `setContextLock` MUST be reverted

**_Scenario#3:_** Context controller wants to unlock a token.

- `setContextLock` MUST be called successfully

**_Scenario#4:_** Ownership manager wants to (unlock and) detach a locked token and the callback controller implements `IERC7695ContextCallback`.

- Caller MUST:
  - Call `requestDetachContext` function successfully
  - Wait at least context detaching duration (see variable `detachingDuration` in the `getContext` function)
  - Call `execDetachContext` function successfully
- `requestDetachContext` MUST call the `onDetachRequested` function despite the call result
- `execDetachContext` MUST call the `onExecDetachContext` function despite the call result

**_Scenario#5:_** Ownership manager wants to (unlock and) detach a locked token and the callback controller does not implement `IERC7695ContextCallback`.

- Caller MUST:
  - Call `requestDetachContext` function successfully
  - Wait at least context detaching duration (see variable `detachingDuration` in the `getContext` function)
  - Call `execDetachContext` function successfully

**_Scenario#6:_** Ownership manager wants to detach an unlocked token and the callback controller implements `IERC7695ContextCallback`.

- Caller MUST call `requestDetachContext` function successfully
- `requestDetachContext` MUST call the `onExecDetachContext` function despite the result
- `execDetachContext` MUST NOT be called

**_Scenario#7:_** Ownership manager wants to detach an unlocked token and the callback controller does not implement `IERC7695ContextCallback`.

- Caller MUST call `requestDetachContext` function successfully
- `execDetachContext` MUST NOT be called

**Rules**

**setContextLock rules**

- MUST revert if the token is requested for detachment.
- MUST revert if the method caller is not context controller.
- MUST emit the event `ContextLockUpdated` on success.

**requestDetachContext rules**

- MUST revert if the method caller is not an ownership manager or approved accounts to manage the tokens for ownership manager (via `setApprovalForAll` function).
- If the token context is locked, MUST emit the `ContextDetachRequested` event. After the above conditions are met, this function MUST check if the controller address is a smart contract (e.g. code size > 0). If so, it MUST call `onDetachRequested` and the call result MUST be skipped.
  - The `data` argument provided by the caller MUST be passed with its contents unaltered to the `onDetachRequested` hook function via its `data` argument.
- If the token context is not locked, MUST emit the `ContextDetached` event. After the above conditions are met, this function MUST check if the controller address is a smart contract (e.g. code size > 0). If so, it MUST call `onExecDetachContext` and the call result MUST be skipped.
  - The `data` argument provided by the caller MUST be passed with its contents unaltered to the `onExecDetachContext` hook function via its `data` argument.

**execDetachContext** **rules**

- MUST revert if the method caller is not an ownership manager or approved accounts to manage the tokens for ownership manager (via `setApprovalForAll` function).
- MUST revert unless the caller requested detachment and waited for at least detaching duration (see variable `detachingDuration` in the `getContext` function).
- MUST emit the `ContextDetached` event.
- After the above conditions are met, this function MUST check if the controller address is a smart contract (e.g. code size > 0). If so, it MUST call `onExecDetachContext` and the call result MUST be skipped.
  - The `data` argument provided by the caller MUST be passed with its contents unaltered to the `onExecDetachContext` hook function via its `data` argument.

### **Additional Transfer** Rules

In addition to extending from [ERC-721](./eip-721.md) for the transfer mechanism when transferring an NFT, the implementation:

- MUST revert if the caller is not an ownership manager.
- MUST detach all attached contexts if any.
- MUST revoke ownership delegation if any.

## **Rationale**

When designing the proposal, we considered the following concerns.

### **Multiple contexts for multiple use cases**

This proposal is centered around Token Context to allow for the creation of distinct contexts tailored to various decentralized applications (dApps). The context controller assumes the role of facilitating (rental or delegation) dApps, by enabling the granting of usage rights to another user without modifying the NFT's ownership record. Besides, this proposal provides the lock feature for contexts to ensure trustlessness in performing these dApps, especially staking cases.

### Providing an unlock mechanism for ownership

An essential aspect of token management is providing an unlock mechanism for owners. Without this mechanism, the owners are unable to unlock their tokens independently and must rely on the context controller to initiate the unlocking process, and there are some cases, in which the controller could lose control, the owners are completely unable to unlock their tokens.

Hence, in response to unlock requests from the ownership manager, DApp contracts need to be designed to accommodate scenarios where locked tokens can be unlocked through ownership rights.

### Skipping detaching request results

The callback results of the `onDetachRequested` and `onExecDetachContext` functions in the **Token (Un)lock Rules** are not handled because we are intentionally removing the controller's power to stop detachment, ensuring token detachment is independent of the controller's actions.

### Ownership delegation

This feature provides a novel approach through the segregation of owner and ownership. Primarily designed to facilitate delegating for third parties, this separation enables the designation of another account as the manager of ownership, distinct from the owner.

Unlike `approve` or `setApprovalForAll` methods, which merely grant permission to other accounts while maintaining ownership status. The current approach with ownership delegation, transcends mere permission granting. It involves the transfer of the owner's rights to delegatee, with provisions for automatic transfer back upon expiration. This mechanism prevents potential abuses, such as requesting mortgages and transfers to alternative accounts if the owner retains ownership rights. Thereby ensuring the integrity and stability of mortgage arrangements within the NFT ecosystem.

The **2-step delegation** process is designed to prevent mistakes in assigning delegatees, it must be done through two steps: offer and confirm. In cases the delegation needs to be canceled before its scheduled expiry, the delegatees can invoke `stopOwnershipDelegation` method.

## **Backwards Compatibility**

This proposal is backward compatible with [ERC-721](./eip-721.md).

## Security Considerations

### Detaching duration

When developing this token standard to serve multiple contexts:

- The contract deployer should establish an appropriate upper threshold for detachment delay (by `maxDetachingDuration` method).
- The context owner should anticipate potential use cases and establish an appropriate period not larger than the upper threshold.

This precaution is essential to mitigate the risk of the owner abusing systems by spamming listings and transferring tokens to another owner in a short time.

### Duplicated token usage

When initiating a new context, the context controllers should track all other contexts within the NFT contract to prevent duplicated usage. For example, suppose a scenario where a token is locked for rental purposes within a particular game. If that game introduces another context (e.g. supporting delegation in that game), it could lead to duplicated token usage within the game, despite being intended for different contexts. In such cases, a shared context for rental and delegation purposes can be considered. Or there must be some restrictions on the new delegation context to prevent reusing that token in the game.

### Ownership delegation Buffer time

When constructing systems that rely on ownership delegation for product development, it is imperative to incorporate a buffer time (of at least `maxDetachingDuration` seconds) when requesting ownership delegation. This precaution is essential to mitigate the risk of potential abuse, particularly if one of the associated contexts locks the token until the delegation time expires.

For example, consider a scenario where a mortgage contract is built atop this standard, which has a maximum detaching duration of 7 days, while the required delegation period is only 3 days. In such cases, without an adequate buffer time, the owner could exploit the system by withdrawing funds and triggering the relevant context to lock the token, thus preventing its unlock and transfer.

### Recommended practices

**Rental**

This is a typical use case for rentals, supposing A(owner) owns a token and wants to list his/her token for rent, and B(user) wants to rent the token to play in a certain game.

![Rental Flow](../assets/eip-7695/rental.png)

**Mortgage**

When constructing collateral systems, it is recommended to support token owners who wish to rent out their tokens while using them for collateral lending. This approach enhances the appeal of mortgage systems, creating a more attractive and versatile financial ecosystem that meets many different needs

This is a typical use case for mortgages, supposing A(owner) owns a token and wants to mortgage, and B(lender) wants to earn interest by lending their funds to A.

![Mortgage Flow](../assets/eip-7695/mortgage.png)

### Risk of Token Owner

**Phishing attacks**

It is crucial to note that the owner role has the ability to delegate ownership to another account, allowing it to authorize transfers out of the respective wallet. Consequently, some malicious actors could deceive the token owner into delegating them as a delegatee by invoking the `startDelegateOwnership` method. This risk can be considered the same as the `approve` or `setApprovalForAll` methods.

**Ownership rights loss**

When interacting with a contract system (e.g. mortgage), where owners have to delegate their ownership rights to the smart contract, it's imperative to:

- Ensure the timeframe for delegation is reasonable and not excessively distant. If the contract mandates a delegation period that extends too far into the future, make sure it includes a provision to revoke ownership delegation when specific conditions are met. Failing to include such a provision could lead to the loss of ownership rights until the delegation expires.
- Be aware that if the contract owner is compromised, the token ownership can be altered.
