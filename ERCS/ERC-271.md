## Abstract

ERC-271 (SHIELD Security Token Standard) introduces a security token implementation with unique serial numbers for each token, burn and remint capabilities for fraud mitigation, batch agent monitoring, and treasury management for unclaimed tokens. It is designed for the GuardianShield platform to enhance digital asset compliance, security, and traceability.

## Motivation

Security tokens require robust tracking, fraud response, and compliance features not present in existing standards. ERC-271 fills this gap by combining unique identification, agent-based monitoring, and a lifecycle that supports burn/remint for theft, fraud, or contamination. The standard ensures that rightful owners can recover assets and unclaimed tokens are managed responsibly.

## Specification

### 1. Token Properties

- Each ERC-271 token has a unique serial number (`serialNumber`).
- Tokens are non-fungible and individually tracked.
- Tokens are assigned to a batch, each monitored by an agent.

### 2. Burn Feature

- Tokens can be burned in the event of theft, fraudulent purchase, or contamination.
- Burn events must be logged with reason and agent information.

### 3. Reminting Process

- If documentation proves rightful ownership, burned tokens are reminted and returned to the owner.
- If unclaimed after a defined period, tokens are reminted and transferred to the GuardianShield treasury.

### 4. Agent Oversight

- Each batch is assigned an agent responsible for monitoring, compliance, and incident reporting.

### 5. Events

```solidity
event TokenBurned(uint256 tokenId, string reason, address indexed agent);
event TokenReminted(uint256 tokenId, address indexed to, address indexed agent, bool returnedToOwner);
event AgentAssigned(uint256 batchId, address agent);
```

### 6. Core Interface

```solidity
interface IERC271 {
    function serialNumber(uint256 tokenId) external view returns (string memory);
    function burn(uint256 tokenId, string calldata reason) external;
    function remint(uint256 tokenId, address to, bool returnedToOwner) external;
    function assignAgent(uint256 batchId, address agent) external;
}
```

### 7. Treasury Management

- Unclaimed tokens are reminted and sent to the GuardianShield treasury wallet.

### 8. Compliance & Documentation

- Reminting requires proof of ownership (off-chain process, referenced on-chain via event).
- Agent monitoring and reporting are off-chain but referenced on-chain via events.

## Rationale

- Unique serial numbers enable traceability and regulatory compliance.
- Burn/remint features mitigate risks associated with digital securities.
- Agent oversight introduces accountability for token batches.
- Treasury management ensures no assets remain untracked.

## Backwards Compatibility

ERC-271 builds on ERC-721 (non-fungible tokens) and is compatible with ERC-20 (fungible tokens) for treasury operations.

## Reference Implementation

A sample Solidity contract implementing ERC-271 is provided separately.

## Test Cases

- Mint, assign serial number, and agent.
- Burn with reason by agent.
- Remint to owner with documentation.
- Remint to treasury after unclaimed period.
