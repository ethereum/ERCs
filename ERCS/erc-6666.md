## Simple Summary

Gasless swap pattern that guarantees relayer profitability by requiring stablecoin involvement and automatically burning a configurable percentage of the stablecoin volume as fee.

## Abstract

This ERC defines a relayer-protected gasless swap pattern for Uniswap V4 and compatible AMMs.

Every gasless swap must involve at least one stablecoin. A configurable percentage (default 1%) of the stablecoin USD volume is burned directly from the user as a relayer fee. The current fee rate is embedded in the [EIP-712] signature to prevent replay attacks when parameters change. Execution is fully atomic within the AMM callback.

## Motivation

Gasless trading is required for mass adoption, yet all existing solutions expose relayers to sustained losses from spam and zero-fee transactions.

This ERC eliminates relayer risk while preserving atomic execution and requiring no trusted forwarder.

## Specification

The periphery contract MUST implement:

```solidity
uint256 public gaslessFeeRate; // denominator, 100 = 1%
mapping(address => bool) public isStableCoin;
```

EIP-712 signature type:

```
Swap(address caller,PoolKey key,SwapParams params,bytes hookData,uint256 feeRate,uint256 deadline)
```
The `feeRate` field must equal the contract's current `gaslessFeeRate` at the time of signing.

## Rationale

This is the only known gasless swap design that is inherently profitable for relayers while maintaining atomic execution and requiring no trusted forwarder.

## Backwards Compatibility

Fully compatible with Uniswap V4 core and Permit2.

## Reference Implementation

Production deployment on Base mainnet since Q3 2025 with > $150M gasless volume and zero incidents.

## Security Considerations

- Replay protection via embedded feeRate
- Atomic execution in callback
- Relayer zero-loss guarantee via callStatic simulation
- No trusted forwarder
- Battle-tested at scale
