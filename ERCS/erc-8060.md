## Abstract
This proposal introduces `IERC721Value`, an extension to [ERC-721](./eip-721.md) that lets each non-fungible token natively hold and later redeem ETH.

## Motivation
Today, NFTs represent ownership but hold no intrinsic on-chain value. `IERC721Value` embeds ETH per token, linking cultural meaning to verifiable economic weight.

## Specification
This ERC extends [ERC-721](./eip-721.md) and adds:
- `valueOf(uint256 tokenId) â†’ uint256`: returns the ETH embedded for a token.
- `mintWithValue(address to, uint256 tokenId)` (**payable**): mints a token embedding `msg.value`.
- `burn(uint256 tokenId)`: burns a token and refunds the embedded ETH to the owner.

## Rationale
The design preserves ERC-721 compatibility while enabling per-token ETH balances as verifiable, on-chain collateral.

## Security Considerations
Implementations must protect against reentrancy on refunds and ensure only the token owner can withdraw embedded ETH.
