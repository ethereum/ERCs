## Abstract

[ERC-8055](./eip-8055.md) introduces the GuardianShield Security Token, a self-directed cryptocurrency token with embedded autonomous protection mechanisms. It enables theft detection, recovery protocols, and dynamic security escalation—all within the token contract itself.

## Motivation

Traditional tokens like [ERC-20](./eip-20.md) lack native security features, leaving users vulnerable to theft, loss, and unauthorized transfers. GuardianShield addresses these limitations by embedding self-protection directly into the token logic.

## Specification

GuardianShield tokens implement the following:

- **Security Hooks**: On-chain triggers for suspicious activity  
- **Recovery Contracts**: Optional modules for restoring stolen tokens  
- **Escalation Protocols**: Time-based or behavior-based lockdowns  
- **Validator Integration**: Compatibility with off-chain fraud detection oracles  

All GuardianShield tokens are fully compatible with [ERC-20](./eip-20.md) and can be wrapped or migrated from legacy tokens.

## Rationale

The design prioritizes user sovereignty and protocol-level defense. By embedding security logic, ERC-8055 reduces reliance on centralized recovery services and mitigates systemic risk in DeFi ecosystems.

## Backwards Compatibility

ERC-8055 is built on [ERC-20](./eip-20.md), ensuring seamless integration with existing wallets, exchanges, and DeFi protocols.

## Reference Implementation

A complete implementation is available at [GuardianShield GitHub](https://github.com/guardianshield/assets/erc-8055).

## Security Considerations

GuardianShield introduces autonomous logic that must be carefully audited. Recovery contracts should be opt-in and transparent. Escalation protocols must balance user control with effective threat mitigation.
