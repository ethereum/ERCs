## Abstract

This extension adds a renewable allowance mechanism to [ERC-20](./eip-20.md) allowances, in which a `recoveryRate` defines the amount of token per second that the allowance regains towards the initial maximum approval `amount`.

## Motivation

Currently, ERC-20 tokens support allowances, with which token owners can allow a spender to spend a certain amount of tokens on their behalf. However, this is not ideal in circumstances involving recurring payments (e.g. subscriptions, salaries, recurring direct-cost-averaging purchases).

Many existing DApps circumvent this limitation by requesting that users grant a large or unlimited allowance. This presents a security risk as malicious DApps can drain users' accounts up to the allowance granted, and users may not be aware of the implications of granting allowances.

An auto-renewable allowance enables many traditional financial concepts like credit and debit limits. An account owner can specify a spending limit, and limit the amount charged to the account based on an allowance that recovers over time.


## Specification

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

        address to,
        uint256 amount
    ) external returns (bool);

    /**

    function allowance(address _owner, address _spender)
        external
        view
        returns (uint256 remaining);
}
```

Base method `approve(address _spender, uint256 _value)` MUST set `recoveryRate` to 0.

Both `allowance()` and `transferFrom()` MUST be updated to include allowance recovery logic.

`approveRenewable(address _spender, uint256 _value, uint256 _recoveryRate)` MUST set both the initial allowance amount and the maximum allowance limit (to which the allowance can recover) to `_value`.

`supportsInterface(0x93cd7af6)` MUST return `true`.

### Additional interfaces

**Token Proxy**

Existing ERC-20 tokens can delegate allowance enforcement to a proxy contract that implements this specification. An additional query function exists to get the underlying ERC-20 token.

```solidity
interface IERC5827Proxy /* is IERC5827 */ {

    /*
     * Note: the ERC-165 identifier for this interface is 0xc55dae63.
     * 0xc55dae63 ===
     *   bytes4(keccak256('baseToken()')
     */

    /**
     * @notice   Get the underlying base token being proxied.
     * @return   baseToken address of the base token
     */
    function baseToken() external view returns (address);
}
```

The `transfer()` function on the proxy MUST NOT emit the `Transfer` event (as the underlying token already does so).

**Automatic Expiration**

```solidity
interface IERC5827Expirable /* is IERC5827 */ {
    /*
     * Note: the ERC-165 identifier for this interface is 0x46c5b619.
     * 0x46c5b619 ===
     *   bytes4(keccak256('approveRenewable(address,uint256,uint256,uint64)')) ^
     *   bytes4(keccak256('renewableAllowance(address,address)')) ^
     */

    /**
     * @notice  Grants an allowance of `_value` to `_spender` initially, which recovers over time
     * @notice  at a rate of `_recoveryRate` up to a limit of `_value` and expires at
     * @notice  `_expiration`.
     * @dev     SHOULD throw when `_recoveryRate` is larger than `_value`, and MUST emit
     * @dev     `RenewableApproval` event.
     * @param   _spender        allowed spender of token
     * @param   _value          initial allowance granted to spender
     * @param   _recoveryRate   recovery amount per second
     * @param   _expiration     Unix time (in seconds) at which the allowance expires
     */
    function approveRenewable(
        address _spender,
        uint256 _value,
        uint256 _recoveryRate,
        uint64 _expiration
    ) external returns (bool success);

    /**
     * @notice  Returns approved max amount, recovery rate, and expiration timestamp.
     * @return  amount initial and maximum allowance granted to spender
     * @return  recoveryRate recovery amount per second
     * @return  expiration Unix time (in seconds) at which the allowance expires
     */
    function renewableAllowance(address _owner, address _spender)
        external
        view
        returns (uint256 amount, uint256 recoveryRate, uint64 expiration);
}
```

## Rationale

Renewable allowances can be implemented with discrete resets per time cycle. However, a continuous `recoveryRate` allows for more flexible use cases not bound by reset cycles and can be implemented with simpler logic.

## Backwards Compatibility

Existing ERC-20 token contracts can delegate allowance enforcement to a proxy contract that implements this specification.

## Reference Implementation

An minimal implementation is included [here](../assets/eip-5827/ERC5827.sol)

An audited, open source implemention of this standard as a `IERC5827Proxy` can be found at `https://github.com/suberra/funnel-contracts`

## Security Considerations

This EIP introduces a stricter set of constraints compared to ERC-20 with unlimited allowances. However, when `_recoveryRate` is set to a large value, large amounts can still be transferred over multiple transactions.

Applications that are not [ERC-5827](./eip-5827.md)-aware may erroneously infer that the value returned by `allowance(address _owner, address _spender)` or included in `Approval` events is the maximum amount of tokens that `_spender` can spend from `_owner`. This may not be the case, such as when a renewable allowance is granted to `_spender` by `_owner`.
