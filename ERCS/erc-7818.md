## Abstract

Introduces an extension for [ERC-20](./eip-20.md) tokens, which facilitates the implementation of an expiration mechanism. Through this extension, tokens have a predetermined validity period, after which they become invalid and can no longer be transferred or used. This functionality proves beneficial in scenarios such as time-limited bonds, loyalty rewards, or game tokens necessitating automatic invalidation after a specific duration. The extension is crafted to seamlessly align with the existing [ERC-20](./eip-20.md) standard, ensuring smooth integration with the prevailing token smart contract while introducing the capability to govern and enforce token expiration at the contract level.

## Motivation

This extension facilitates the development of [ERC-20](./eip-20.md) standard compatible tokens featuring expiration dates. This capability broadens the scope of potential applications, particularly those involving time-sensitive assets. Expirable tokens are well-suited for scenarios necessitating temporary validity, including

- Bonds or financial instruments with defined maturity dates
- Time-constrained assets within gaming ecosystems
- Next-gen loyalty programs incorporating expiring rewards or points
- Prepaid credits for utilities or services (e.g., cashback, data packages, fuel, computing resources) that expire if not used within a specified time frame
- Postpaid telecom data package allocations that expire at the end of the billing cycle, motivating users to utilize their data before it resets
- Tokenized e-Money for a closed-loop ecosystem, such as transportation, food court, and retail payments

## Specification

The keywords “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

Compatible implementations MUST inherit from [ERC-20](./eip-20.md)'s interface and **MUST** have all the following functions and all function behavior **MUST** meet the specification.

### Behavior specification

- `balanceOf` **MUST** return the total balance of tokens held by an account that are still valid (i.e., have not expired). This includes any tokens associated with specific periods, epochs, or other identifiers, provided they remain within their validity duration. Expired tokens **MUST NOT** be included in the returned balance, ensuring that only actively usable tokens are reflected in the result.
- `transfer` and `transferFrom` **MUST** exclusively transfer tokens that remain non-expired at the time of the transaction. Attempting to transfer expired tokens **MUST** revert the transaction or return false. Additionally, implementations **MAY** include logic to prioritize the automatic transfer of tokens closest to expiration, ensuring that the earliest expiring tokens are used first, provided they meet the non-expired condition.
- `totalSupply` **SHOULD** be set to `0` or `type(uint256).max` due to the challenges of tracking only valid (non-expired) tokens.
- The implementation **MAY** use a standardized custom error revert message, such as `ERC7818TransferredExpiredToken` or `ERC7818TransferredExpiredToken(address sender, uint256 epoch)`, to clearly indicate that the operation failed due to attempting to transfer expired tokens. 

## Rationale

The rationale for developing an expirable [ERC-20](./eip-20.md) token extension is based on several key requirements that ensure its practicality and adaptability for various applications to

### Compatibility with the existing [ERC-20](./eip-20.md) standard. 
The extension should integrate smoothly with the [ERC-20](./eip-20.md) interface, This ensures compatibility with existing token ecosystems and third-party tools like wallets and blockchain explorers.

### Flexible interface for various implementation. 
The smart contract should be extensible, allowing businesses to tailor the expiration functionality to their specific needs like expiry in bulk or each token independent expire, whether it’s dynamic reward systems or time-sensitive applications.

## Backwards Compatibility

This standard is fully [ERC-20](./eip-20.md) compatible.

## Reference Implementation

For reference implementation can be found [here](../assets/eip-7818/README.md), But in the reference implementation, we employ a sorted list to automatically select the token that nearest expires first with a First-In-First-Out (`FIFO`) and sliding window algorithm that operates based on the `block.number` as opposed to relying on `block.timestamp`, which has been criticized for its lack of security and resilience, particularly given the increasing usage of Layer 2 (L2) networks over Layer 1 (L1) networks. Many L2 networks exhibit centralization and instability, which directly impacts asset integrity, rendering them potentially unusable during periods of network halting, as they are still reliant on the timestamp.

## Security Considerations

### Denial Of Service
Run out of gas problem due to the operation consuming higher gas if transferring multiple groups of small tokens or loop transfer.

### Gas Limit Vulnerabilities
Exceeds block gas limit if the blockchain has a block gas limit lower than the gas used in the transaction.

### Block values as a proxy for time
if using `block.timestamp` for calculating `epoch()` and In rare network halts, block production stops, freezing `block.timestamp` and disrupting time-based logic. This risks asset integrity and inconsistent states.

### Fairness Concerns
In a straightforward implementation, where all tokens within the same epoch share the same expiration (e.g., at `epoch`:`x`), bulk expiration occurs.

### Risks in Liquidity Pools
When tokens with expiration dates are deposited into liquidity pools (e.g., in DEXs), they may expire while still in the pool.
