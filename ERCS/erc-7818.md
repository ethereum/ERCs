## Abstract

Introduces an extension for [ERC-20](./eip-20.md) tokens, which facilitates the implementation of an expiration mechanism. Through this extension, tokens have a predetermined validity period, after which they become invalid and can no longer be transferred or used. This functionality proves beneficial in scenarios such as time-limited bonds, loyalty rewards, or game tokens necessitating automatic invalidation after a specific duration. The extension is crafted to seamlessly align with the existing [ERC-20](./eip-20.md) standard, ensuring smooth integration with the prevailing token smart contract while introducing the capability to govern and enforce token expiration at the contract level.

## Motivation

This extension facilitates the development of [ERC-20](./eip-20.md) standard compatible tokens featuring expiration dates. This capability broadens the scope of potential applications, particularly those involving time-sensitive assets. Expirable tokens are well-suited for scenarios necessitating temporary validity, including:

- Bonds or financial instruments with defined maturity dates
- Time-constrained assets within gaming ecosystems
- Next-gen loyalty programs incorporating expiring rewards or points
- Prepaid credits for utilities or services (e.g., cashback, data packages, fuel, computing resources) that expire if not used within a specified time frame
- Postpaid telecom data package allocations that expire at the end of the billing cycle, motivating users to utilize their data before it resets
- Tokenized e-Money for a closed-loop ecosystem, such as transportation, food court, and retail payments

## Specification

The keywords “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

### Epoch Mechanism

**Epochs** represent a specific period or block range during which certain tokens are valid. They can be categorized into two types

- **block-based** Defined by a specific number of blocks (e.g., 1000 `blocks`).
- **time-based** Defined by a specific duration in seconds (e.g., 1000 `seconds`).

Tokens linked to an `epoch` remain valid as long as the `epoch` is active. Once the specified number of `blocks` or the duration in `seconds` has passed, the `epoch` expires, and any tokens associated with it are considered expired.

### Balance Look Back Over Epochs

To retrieve the usable balance, tokens are checked from the **current epoch** against a **past epoch** (which can be any **_n_** epochs back). The past epoch can be set to any value **n**, allowing flexibility in tracking and summing tokens that are still valid from previous epochs, up to **n** epochs back.

The usable balance is the sum of tokens valid between the **current epoch** and the **past epoch**, ensuring that only non-expired tokens are considered.

#### Example Scenario

| **epoch** | **balance** |
| --------- | ----------- |
| 1         | 100         |
| 2         | 150         |
| 3         | 200         |

- **Current Epoch**: 3
- **Past Epoch**: 1 epoch back
- **Usable Balance**: 350

Tokens from **Epoch 2** and **Epoch 3** are valid. The same logic applies for any **_n_** epochs back, where the usable balance includes tokens from the current epoch and all prior valid epochs.

Compatible implementations MUST inherit from [ERC-20](./eip-20.md)'s interface and **MUST** have all the following functions and all function behavior **MUST** meet the specification.

### Behavior specification

- `balanceOf` **MUST** return the total balance of tokens held by an account that are still valid (i.e., have not expired). This includes any tokens associated with specific epochs, provided they remain within their validity duration. Expired tokens **MUST NOT** be included in the returned balance, ensuring that only actively usable tokens are reflected in the result.
- `balanceOfAtEpoch` **MUST** returns the balance of tokens held by an account at the specified `epoch`, If the specified epoch is expired, this function **MUST** return `0`.
For example, if `epoch` 5 has expired, calling `balanceOfByEpoch(5, address)` returns `0` even if there were tokens previously held in that epoch.
- `currentEpoch` **MUST** return the current `epoch` of the contract.
- `epochLength` **MUST** return duration between `epoch` in blocks or time in seconds.
- `epochType` **MUST** return the type of epoch used by the contract, which can be either `BLOCKS_BASED` or `TIME_BASED`.
- `validityDuration` **MUST** return the validity duration of tokens in terms of `epoch` counts.
- `isEpochExpired` **MUST** return true if the given `epoch` is expired, otherwise `false`.
- `transfer` and `transferFrom` **MUST** exclusively transfer tokens that remain non-expired at the time of the transaction. Attempting to transfer expired tokens **MUST** revert the transaction or return false. Additionally, implementations **MAY** include logic to prioritize the automatic transfer of tokens closest to expiration, ensuring that the earliest expiring tokens are used first, provided they meet the non-expired condition.
- `transferAtEpoch` and `transferFromAtEpoch` **MUST** transfer the specified number of tokens held by an account at the specified epoch to the recipient, If the epoch has expired, the transaction **MUST** `revert` or return `false`
- `totalSupply` **SHOULD** be set to `0` or `type(uint256).max` due to the challenges of tracking only valid (non-expired) tokens.
- The implementation **MAY** use a standardized custom error, such as `ERC7818TransferredExpiredToken` or `ERC7818TransferredExpiredToken(address sender, uint256 epoch)`, to clearly indicate that the operation failed due to attempting to transfer expired tokens.
  
### Additional Potential Useful Function

These **OPTIONAL** functions provide additional functionality that might be useful depending on the specific use case.
- `getEpochBalance` returns the amount of tokens stored in a given `epoch`, even if the `epoch` has expired.
- `getEpochInfo` returns both the start and end of the specified `epoch`.
- `getNearestExpiryOf` returns the token amount closest to expiration, along with an estimated expiration block number or timestamp based on `epochType`.
- `getRemainingDurationBeforeEpochChange` returns the remaining time or blocks before the `epoch` change happens, based on the `epochType`.
  
## Rationale

Although the term `epoch` is an abstract concept, it leaves room for various implementations. For example, epochs can support more granular tracking of tokens within each epoch, allowing for greater control over when tokens are valid or expired on-chain. Alternatively, epochs can support bulk expiration, where all tokens within the same epoch expire simultaneously. This flexibility enables different methods of tracking token expiration, depending on the specific needs of the use case.
`epoch` also introduces a "lazy" way to simplify token expiration tracking in a flexible and gas-efficient manner. Instead of continuously updating the expiration state with `write` operations by the user or additional services, the current epoch can be calculated using a `read` operation.

## Backwards Compatibility

This standard is fully [ERC-20](./eip-20.md) compatible.

## Reference Implementation

For reference implementation can be found [here](../assets/eip-7818/README.md), But in the reference implementation, we employ a sorted list to automatically select the token that nearest expires first with a First-In-First-Out (`FIFO`) and sliding window algorithm that operates based on the `block.number` as opposed to relying on `block.timestamp`, which has been criticized for its lack of security and resilience, particularly given the increasing usage of Layer 2 (L2) networks over Layer 1 (L1) networks. Many L2 networks exhibit centralization and instability, which directly impacts asset integrity, rendering them potentially unusable during periods of network halting, as they are still reliant on the timestamp.

## Security Considerations

### Denial Of Service
Run out of gas problem due to the operation consuming higher gas if transferring multiple groups of small tokens or loop transfer.

### Gas Limit Vulnerabilities
Exceeds block gas limit if the blockchain has a block gas limit lower than the gas used in the transaction.

### Block values as a proxy for time
if using `block.timestamp` for calculating `epoch()` and In rare network halts, block production stops, freezing `block.timestamp` and disrupting time-based logic. This risks asset integrity and inconsistent states.

### Fairness Concerns
In a straightforward implementation, where all tokens within the same epoch share the same expiration (e.g., at `epoch`:`x`), bulk expiration occurs.

### Risks in Liquidity Pools
When tokens with expiration dates are deposited into liquidity pools (e.g., in DEXs), they may expire while still in the pool.
