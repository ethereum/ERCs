## Abstract

Defines a standard interface for smart contracts to declare their legitimacy lineage, observed jurisdiction, and sovereignty status.

## Motivation

Smart contracts are, in essence, digital contracts whose execution is enforced by network consensus. As more organizations and individuals rely on smart contracts to model real-world agreements, a critical component of traditional contracts is noticeably missing: jurisdiction.

Historically, much of the smart-contract ecosystem has emphasized decentralization and self-sovereignty, implicitly assuming that contracts do not rely on any external legal framework. However, many practical use cases—especially those mirroring real-world relationships—do require a clearly defined jurisdiction. When disputes arise, when remedies must be rendered, or when legitimacy needs to be established, the absence of explicit jurisdictional metadata becomes a significant limitation.

This ERC proposes a standardized interface for declaring a contract’s jurisdiction, legitimacy lineage, or explicit lack of jurisdiction.

In many real-world scenarios, a contract derives legitimacy from a recognized authority (for example, by registering a corporation with a state government). Such a contract therefore “observes” a legitimacy lineage granted by that jurisdiction. Conversely, it is equally important—and sometimes fundamental—that certain organizations or individuals claim no external jurisdiction at all. These entities function as sovereign actors, akin to a sovereign nation or a self-sovereign DAO. For them, declaring the absence of jurisdiction is itself a meaningful and intentional assertion of sovereignty.

By standardizing how smart contracts declare jurisdiction, legitimacy lineage, or self-sovereignty, ERC-5485 enables better interoperability with legal systems, regulatory frameworks, and on-chain governance models—bridging a crucial gap between real-world contracts and their digital counterparts.

### Use Cases (Primary)

- Stablecoins (e.g., USDC): Need jurisdiction because reserve custody, redemptions, freezes, and regulatory compliance depend on a specific legal authority.

- Tokenized Stocks / RWAs: Need jurisdiction because securities laws, transfer restrictions, investor rights, and enforcement vary entirely by legal venue.

- Regulated Lending Protocols: Need jurisdiction to define collateral rights, default resolution, licensing requirements, and enforceability of loan agreements.

- Private Company Equity for Qualified Investors: Need jurisdiction to enforce accreditation rules, transfer limits, corporate law, and cap-table legitimacy.

### Use Cases (Secondary)

- Jurisdiction Compatibility Checks: A governance or compliance contract may need to verify that another contract operates under a compatible jurisdiction before allowing interoperability or settlement.

- Regulatory Boundary Enforcement: Bridges, marketplaces, or financial routers can require jurisdiction metadata to ensure they only integrate with contracts that meet their regulatory or licensing requirements.

- Good-Standing Verification: A contract that relies on another (e.g., for custody, issuance, or settlement) can check jurisdiction and legitimacy lineage to confirm that the source contract is valid and recognized by a specific legal authority.

- Access-Control Based on Jurisdiction: An on-chain service may restrict participation to contracts (or entities) incorporated in certain jurisdictions or banned from others (e.g., sanctions, restricted markets).

- Cross-Contract Legal Cohesion: Multi-contract systems (e.g., DAOs with sub-modules or federated organizations) can ensure that every component declares a coherent jurisdictional framework to avoid legal conflicts.

- Automated Dispute-Path Selection: If two contracts interact and later trigger a dispute mechanism, jurisdiction metadata allows automated selection of which legal venue or arbitration path applies.

### Scope

While the motivation highlights many potential use cases, this ERC deliberately narrows its scope to four foundational problems related to jurisdictional semantics on-chain:

0. Representing Sovereignty: How a smart contract explicitly represents the absence of external jurisdiction, i.e., a declaration of self-sovereignty, 
such as a country, a state, a DAO, or an EOA.

1. Declaring Jurisdiction: How a smart contract formally declares that it observes and operates under a specific jurisdiction.

2. Granting Legitimacy: How a jurisdiction-representing smart contract indicates that it recognizes, accepts, and grants legitimacy to the declaring contract.

3. Imposing Verdicts: How legally relevant decisions, rulings, or verdicts can be attached to—or imposed upon—a smart contract that has declared such jurisdiction.


## Specification

The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

1. Compliant contract MUST implement the following interface.

```solidity
interface IERC5485 {
    /// A function that returns the source of legitimacy in an address
    ///
    /// @returns address of EOA or contract that grants legitimacy status to this contract.
    /// See Specification #2 and #3 for more details.
    function sourceOfLegitimacy() public view returns (address);

    /// A function that returns the sovereign jurisdiction in an address
    ///
    /// @returns address of EOA or contract that *ultimately* grants legitimacy status (root of legitimacy lineage).
    /// See Specification #4 and #6 for more details.
    function jurisdiction() public view returns (address);
}
```

2. Suppose a compliant `ContractA` is deployed at address `0x<Contract_Address_A>` and gains its legitimacy from another contract or Externally Owned Account (EOA) at `0x<ADDRESS_B>`. In this case, it MUST return the `0x<ADDRESS_B>` when being queried for `sourceOfLegitimacy()`. For example. If `ContractA` gains legitimacy from `ContractB`, `ContractB` gains legitimacy from `ContractC` but `ContractC` doesn't gain legitimacy from anyone, ContractC is considered the "jurisdiction" that both `ContractB` and `ContractA` observe. Both `ContractA` and `ContractB` MUST return the address of `ContractC` as the result of jurisdiction.

3. A contract that matches ANY of the following cases is considered a "sovereign contract":

- Case 1: it does not implement this EIP
- Case 2: it implements this EIP but return its *own address*.
- Case 3: it implements this EIP but return a ZERO address.

4. Any compliant contract MUST return its legitimacy sources chain up to the sovereign contract when queried by `jurisdiction()`.

5. If ContractA gains legitimacy from ContractB, ContractA MUST observe the ContractB's order to ANY of the following
- Order Type 1: execute a `selfdestruct` of ContractA

6. If ContractA observes jurisdiction of ContractC (a sovereignty), ContractA MUST observe ContractC's order to ANY the following
- Order Type 1: execute a `selfdestruct` of ContractA
- Order Type 2: execute ANY smart contract executable proposals as specified in [ERC-5247](./eip-5247.md)

TODO determine whether to address "add/remove legitimacy" in this EIP or leave it as a future EIP
