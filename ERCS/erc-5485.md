## Abstract

Defines a standard interface for smart contracts to declare their sovereignty status, observed jurisdiction, accreditation within that jurisdiction, and the mechanisms by which they may receive and record enforcement actions.

## Motivation

Smart contracts are, in essence, digital agreements whose execution is enforced by network consensus. As their use increasingly expands into domains that mirror real-world legal or institutional relationships, one critical component present in traditional systems is missing on-chain: a structured way to express sovereignty, jurisdiction, accreditation, and enforcement.

Historically, much of the smart-contract ecosystem has emphasized decentralization and self-sovereignty, implicitly assuming that contracts do not rely on any external legal or institutional framework. However, many practical use cases—especially those that interface with real-world regulations, property rights, or compliance regimes—require an explicit identification of the jurisdiction(s) a contract observes, the authority that has accredited it as a valid actor within that jurisdiction, and the mechanisms by which binding decisions may be communicated to it.

This ERC proposes a standardized interface for representing four foundational concepts:

- **Sovereignty** — whether a contract is self-sovereign or claims allegiance to a higher-order system;
- **Jurisdiction** — which external authority it chooses to observe;
- **Accreditation** — whether that authority formally recognizes the contract as a valid participant within its system; and
- **Enforcement** — how decisions, rulings, or binding actions issued by that authority can be delivered to and acknowledged by the contract.

In many real-world and institutional settings, an entity becomes an actionable participant only after receiving formal accreditation by the relevant authority—whether this is a state chartering a corporation, a school recognizing a student club, a platform onboarding a developer, or a DAO admitting a module into its governance structure. Conversely, some entities explicitly declare their absence of external jurisdictional alignment, operating instead as sovereign actors such as declaration of independence as newly established countries gain their sovereignty, or joining a jurisdictional system as a newly established entity. Representing both modes—subordination and self-sovereignty—is essential for accurately modeling institutional relationships on-chain.

By standardizing how smart contracts declare sovereignty, jurisdiction, accreditation, and enforcement pathways, ERC-5485 enables interoperability between legal systems, regulatory frameworks, institutional hierarchies, and on-chain governance models—bridging a structural gap between real-world systems and their digital counterparts.

### Use Cases (Primary)

The primary use cases address the questions related to the status of a contract themselves. 

- **Stablecoins (e.g., USDC):** Require jurisdiction because reserve custody, redemptions, freezes, and regulatory compliance depend on a specific legal authority.
- **Tokenized Stocks / RWAs:** Require jurisdiction because securities laws, transfer restrictions, investor rights, and enforcement vary entirely by legal venue.
- **Regulated Lending Protocols:** Require jurisdiction to define collateral rights, default resolution, licensing requirements, and enforceability of loan agreements.
- **Private Company Equity for Qualified Investors:** Require jurisdiction to enforce accreditation rules, transfer limits, corporate law, and cap-table validity.

### Use Cases (Secondary)

The secondary use cases address the questions related to the interactions between contracts.

- **Jurisdiction Compatibility Checks:** Ensuring that interacting contracts operate under compatible or acceptable jurisdictions.
- **Regulatory Boundary Enforcement:** Gateways, bridges, or marketplaces can restrict integration to contracts meeting specific jurisdictional or accreditation requirements.
- **Good-Standing Verification:** Validating whether a contract is accredited and in compliance under its declared jurisdiction.
- **Jurisdiction-Based Access Control:** Allowing or restricting participation based on jurisdiction or accreditation metadata.
- **Cross-Contract Legal Cohesion:** Ensuring coherent jurisdictional alignment across multi-contract systems, federated DAOs, or hierarchical governance structures.
- **Automated Dispute-Path Selection:** Determining which arbitration venue, legal process, or enforcement route applies when disputes ar

## Specification

The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

1. Compliant contract MUST implement the following interface.

```solidity
struct IERC5247Executable {
    address target;
    uint256 value;
    uint256 gasLimit;
    bytes data;
}

struct IERC5247Executables {
    IERC5247Executable[] executables;
}

interface IERC5485 {
    function sourceOfAccreditation() public view returns (address);
    function jurisdiction() public view returns (address);
    function imposeEnforcement(IERC5247Executables _proposal) public payable;
}
```
