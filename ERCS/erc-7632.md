## Abstract

Extends tokens using `uint256 tokenId` to support `tokenName` in type `string` and be able to convert backward to `tokenId`.

## Motivation

For Marketplaces, Explorers, Wallets, DeFi and dApps to better display and operate NFTs that comes with a name.

## Specification

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.

1. Compliant contracts MUST support `tokenName` and
mapping between `tokenName` and `tokenId` in one of the following ways:
  - 1a all compliant contracts are RECOMMENDED to implement the following 
interfaces: `IERC_NamedTokenCore`, 
```solidity
interface IERC_NamedTokenCore {
  function idToName(uint256 _tokenId) external view returns (string);
  function nameToId(string memory _tokenName) external returns (uint256);
}
```

and it should satisfy the behavior rules that:
    - 1a.1. when a new name is instroduced, it is RECOMMENDED to emit an event `newName(uint256 indexed tokenId, string tokenName)`.
    - 1a.2. tokenId and tokenName MUST be two-way single mapping, meaning if tokenId exists, tokenName MUST exist and vice versa and
      `tokenId = nameToId(idToName(tokenId))` and 
      `tokenName = idToName(nameToId(tokenName))` MUST hold true.

  - 1b. if the compliant doesn't implement `IERC_NamedTokenCore`,
it MAY follow the default mapping rule between `tokenId` and `tokenName`
`uint256 tokenId = uint256(keccak256(tokenName))`.

2. All method involving `tokenId` for a compliant contract is RECOMMENDED to
have a counterpart method end with `ByName` that substitute all
pamameters of `uint256 tokenId` with `string memory tokenName`, 
and the behavior of the counterpart method MUST be consistent
with the original method.

3. Compliant contract MAY implement one or more of following extra interface

```solidity
interface IERC_NamedTokenExtension {
  function isValidTokenName(string memory _tokenName) external view returns (string);
  function normalizeTokenName(string memory _tokenName) external view returns (string memory);
}
```

## Rationale

1. We allow default way to map `tokenId` and `tokenName` for convenience, but
we also allow contract to implement their own way to map `tokenId` and
`tokenName` for flexibility.

2. We consider providing an interface for 

## Backwards Compatibility

This proposal is fully backwards compatible with token contracts using
`uint256 tokenId` as the unique identifier.

## Security Considerations

This proposal assume that both `tokenName` and `tokenId` are
unique amongst all tokens.

If tokenNames are not normalize, two distinct tokenNames may confuse users
as they look alike. Contract developer shall declare normalization mechanism if
non-unique `tokenName` is allowed using `IERC_NamedTokenExtension`.
