## Simple Summary
An extension to the [ERC-20] standard token that allows Token wallet owners to request payout from their wallet, by calling the smart contract and attaching a payout instruction string.

## Actors

#### Token Wallet Owners
The person or company who owns the wallet, and will order payout.

#### Token contract owner / agent
The entity, company responsible/owner of the token contract, and token issuing/minting. This actor is in charge of trying to fulfill all payout request(s), reading the payout instruction(s), and correlate the payout details.

#### Orderer
An actor who is enabled to initiate payout orders on behalf of a token wallet owner.

## Abstract
Token wallet owners (or approved addresses) can order payout requests through  blockchain. This is done by calling the ```orderPayoutFrom``` or ```orderPayoutFrom``` methods, which initiate the workflow for the token contract operator to either honor or reject the payout request. In this case, payout instructions are provided when submitting the request, which are used by the operator to determine the destination of the funds.

In general, it is not advisable to place explicit routing instructions for the payouts on a verbatim basis on the blockchain, and it is advised to use a private communication alternatives, such as private channels, encrypted storage or similar, to do so (external to the blockchain ledger). Another (less desirable) possibility is to place these instructions on the instructions field in encrypted form.

## Motivation
Nowadays most of the token payout requests, need a previous centralized transaction, to be able to define the payout destination to be able to execute the payout (burn transaction).
In the aim of trying to bring all the needed steps into decentralization, exposing all the needed steps of token lifecycle and payment transactions, a payout request can allow wallet owner to initiate the payout order via blockchain.
Key benefits:

* Payout, burning  traceability is enhanced bringing the initiation into the ledger. All payment, payout statuses can be stored on chain.
* Almost all money/token lifecycle is covered via a decentralized approach, complemented with private communications which is common use in the ecosystem.

In this case, the following movement of tokens are done as the process progresses:

* Upon launch of the payout request, the appropriate amount of funds are placed on a hold with a predefined notary defined by the platform, and the payout is placed into a ```Ordered``` state
* The operator then can put the payout request ```InProcess```, which prevents the _orderer_ of the payout from being able to cancel the payout request
* After checking the payout is actually possible the operator then executes the hold, which moves the funds to a suspense wallet and places the payout into the ```FundsInSuspense``` state
* The operator then moves the funds offchain (usually from the omnibus account)  to the appropriate destination account, then burning the tokens from the suspense wallet and rendering the payout into the ```Executed``` state
* Either before or after placing the request ```InProcess```, the operator can also reject the payout, which returns the funds to the payer and eliminates the hold. The resulting end state of the payout is ```Rejected```
* When the payout is ```Ordered``` and before the operator places it into the ```InProcess``` state, the orderer of the payout can also cancel it, which frees up the hold and puts the payout into the final ```Cancelled``` state

## Rationale
This standards provides a functionality to allow token holders to start payout requests in a decentralized way.

It's important to highlight that the token operator, need to process all payout request, updating the payout status based on the linked payment that will be done.

Payout instruction format is open. ISO payment standard like is a good start point.

This EIP uses [EIP-1996] to hold the money after a payout is ordered. The token contract owner or agent, whose implementation is not part of this proposal, acts as a predefined notary to decide if the payout is executed or not.

The `operationId` is a string and not something more gas efficient to allow easy traceability of the hold and allow human readable ids. It is up to the implementer if the string should be stored on-chain or only its hash, as it is enough to identify a hold.

The `operationId` is a competitive resource. It is recommended, but not required, that the hold issuers used a unique prefix to avoid collisions.

## Backwards Compatibility
This EIP is fully backwards compatible as its implementation extends the functionality of [ERC-20] and [ERC-1996].

## Implementation
The GitHub repository [IoBuilders/payoutable-token](https://github.com/IoBuilders/payoutable-token) contains the reference implementation.
