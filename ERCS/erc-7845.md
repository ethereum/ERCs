## Abstract

> "Hey smart speaker, swap my Shiba Inu for Pillar"

> "Assistant, how much USDC can I buy with what's in my wallet?"

> "Send 10 OP to Vitalik and 5 PEPE to Deimantas"

The Universal Orchestrator RPC aims to standardise the **minimum shape and requirements** of a **request for a solution** **_from_** an arbitrary system managing an Ethereum wallet **_to_**, ultimately, an Orchestrator.

An arbitrary system could be a website, device, app, server program etc - anything that manages an Ethereum wallet, **speaks Ethereum JSON-RPC** and is looking to request solutions from an Orchestrator.

All solutions from an Orchestrator are ChA¹ (Chain Abstraction-first) by default.

![Flow](../assets/eip-7845/flow.jpg)

## Motivation

Data model standards can be written in any shape. A system will often expose their external interface but require that the request to the aforementioned interface is modelled in a way that the service understands. This creates a huge level of inconsistency and in turn makes Orchestrator interoperability more difficult.

Orchestrators will become more widespread and numerous over time. This is especially true with the advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI) driven systems, the continued advancement of Human Computer Interaction (HCI) devices (especially those that are voice controlled) and the emergence of Extended Reality (XR) platforms.

Standardising the request object that an Orchestrator can understand from a wallet will drive adoption and make decentralised app development easier for developers that don't know how to make on-chain transactions or have the required technical understanding of block building systems.

## Specification

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.

The Orchestrator's external interface(s) that expose functionality to an end-user application or another system MUST use JavaScript Object Notation (JSON).

The following data definitions are available and MUST **prefer chain abstraction (ChA¹)**, unless stated. Chain abstraction means that, where possible, should an asset span multiple chains - expect a solution from an Orchestrator to use and send assets to and from the supported chains to deliver a complete and cost-effective solution.

The following sequence diagram shows the flow of events in this proposal:

![Sequence Diagram](../assets/eip-7845/sequence.png)

This specification follows the top level data shape of Ethereum JSON-RPC requests, as shown below:

### Request

The request definition is what a wallet sends to an Orchestrator for solutions to one or more problems. The request follows the specification from Ethereum JSON-RPC.

#### RPC

```typescript
interface Rpc: {
    id: number; // REQUIRED
    jsonrpc: string; // REQUIRED
    method: string; // REQUIRED
    params: Problem[]; // REQUIRED
}
```

The top level definition is an Ethereum RPC object.

- The `id` property is a random number that you can assign for your own purposes.
- The `jsonrpc` property takes a `string` that represents the version of JSON-RPC being used. Usually `"2.0"`.
- The `method` property is the method call intended for the Orchestrator, and by default CAN be `orchestrator_findSolutions`.
- The `params` property contains an array of `Problem` objects, and is REQUIRED. The Problem object is defined below.

#### Problem

```typescript
interface Problem: {
    actions: Action[] // REQUIRED
    chainId: number; // OPTIONAL
}
```

The `Problem` definition has just one REQUIRED property, `actions`. The `Problem` interface leaves space for additional properties in future network upgrades and existing or emerging standards.

- The `actions` property takes an `array` of `Action` objects, defined below, and is REQUIRED.
- The `chainId` takes a `number`, representing the chain ID, and is OPTIONAL.
  - If no `chainId` is provided:
    - `chainId` property MUST assume `1`

#### Action

```typescript
interface Action: {
    from: string; // REQUIRED
    towards: (Asset|Destination)[]; // REQUIRED
    with: Offering[]; // OPTIONAL
    type: string; // OPTIONAL
    functionCallName: string; // OPTIONAL
    functionCallData: string; // OPTIONAL
    deadline: number; // OPTIONAL
}
```

The `Action` definition has several properties that indicate the desired action. The set properties determine the action that needs to be solved.

- The `from` property is REQUIRED, takes a `string` and represents the wallet that this `Action` is for.
- The `towards` property is REQUIRED, takes an `array` of either an `Asset` or a `Destination` type and represents where this `Action` is targeted towards.
- The `with` property is OPTIONAL, takes an `array` of `Offering` type and represents what assets the wallet is prepared to offer to facilitate this `Action`
  - If the `with` property contains no `Offering` entries, then the Orchestrator MUST consider all assets available in the address space for an `Offering`.
- The `type` property is OPTIONAL, takes a `string` and is intended to help classify this action. Examples might include, but are not limited to - `transfer`, `swap`, `call` etc and is intended to assist the Orchestrator with the action.
  - If no `type` is provided, then 'transfer' MUST be assumed
- The `functionCallName` property is OPTIONAL, takes a `string` and represents the function name to call against the `towards` property. If this is defined, the Orchestrator can be assumed that this Action desires to call a smart contract as part of the action.
- The `functionCallData` property is OPTIONAL, takes a `string` and represents the data payload for `functionCallName`. If this is defined but `functionCallName` is not, this property SHOULD be ignored.
- The `deadline` property is OPTIONAL, takes a `number` and represents a wallet-defined unix timestamp for when an action should have a solution by. Useful for high throughput systems, or time sensitive actions.

#### Asset

```typescript
interface Asset: {
    symbol: string; // OPTIONAL
    address: string; // OPTIONAL
    chainId: number; // OPTIONAL
}
```

The Asset definition defines an asset in question. This definition prefers chain abstraction.

- The `symbol` property is OPTIONAL, takes a `string` and represents the symbol of the Asset in question.
  - if no `symbol` is provided, `address` must be used
- The `address` property is OPTIONAL, takes a `string` and represents the `address` of the smart contract for this `Asset`.
  - if no `address` is provided, the native gas token MUST be used
- The `chainId` property is OPTIONAL, takes a `number` and represents the chain that this asset resides on. Useful for direct targeting of an `Asset` on a particular chain.
- If no `chainId` is provided: - The Orchestrator is free to use any corresponding asset on any chain to facilitate the action

#### Destination

```typescript
interface Destination: {
    address: string; // REQUIRED
    chainId: number; // REQUIRED
}
```

The Destination definition defines a direct target and is used in scenarios where the Orchestrator interpretation MUST NOT be used.

- The `address` property is REQUIRED and takes a `string` that represents the address space for this `Destination`.
- The `chainId` property is REQUIRED and takes a `number` and represents the chain the above `address` property resides on.

#### Offering

```typescript
interface Offering: {
    symbol: string; // SHOULD
    address: string; // SHOULD
    amount: (number|string); // OPTIONAL
    chainId: number; // OPTIONAL
}
```

The `Offering` definition defines what the requester is willing to spend from their wallet in order to facilitate the action being solved.

- The `symbol` property SHOULD be specified and represents the symbol of the `Offering` in question
  - If no `symbol` is provided, the address MUST be used
- The `address` property SHOULD be specified and takes a `string` that represents the address space for this `Offering`.
  - If no `address` is provided, the native gas token MUST be used
- The `amount` property is OPTIONAL and represents the amount to be offered as part of the `Action`. Accepts either a `number`, which represents an ether unit, or a `string` which can be used for BigNumbers.
  - If no amount is provided, the maximum value of the address, symbol or native gas unit must be assumed
- The `chainId` property is OPTIONAL and takes a `number` that represents the chain the above `address` property resides on.
  - If no `chainId` is provided:
    - `address` MUST NOT be used
    - `symbol` MUST be used (ChA¹)
    - If no higher level `chainId` property exists in the `Problem` property
      - The Orchestrator is free to use any corresponding asset on any chain to facilitate the action (ChA¹)

### Response

The response definition is what an Orchestrator sends back as a response to the request for solutions from a wallet. The response, like the request, follows the specification from Ethereum JSON-RPC.

#### RPC

```typescript
interface Rpc: {
    id: string; // REQUIRED
    jsonrpc: string; // REQUIRED
    result: Solution[]; // REQUIRED
}
```

The top level object is an Ethereum RPC object.

- The `id` property is REQUIRED, takes a `string` and MUST correlate to the same `number` that was received as part of the request object to the Orchestrator.
- The `jsonrpc` property is REQUIRED, takes a `string` and represents the version of JSON-RPC being used. Usually `"2.0"`.
- The `result` property is REQUIRED and takes an array of `Solution` objects. The `Solution` object is defined below.

#### Solution

```typescript
interface Solution: {
    name: string; // REQUIRED
    description: string; // OPTIONAL
    transactions: Transaction[]; // REQUIRED
    deadline: number; // OPTIONAL
}
```

The above `Solution` interface is the _solution_ to a _problem_ requested above. The `Solution` MUST be in the same order to a `Problem` that was requested.

- The `name` property is REQUIRED, takes a `string` and represents a short, non-technical and user-friendly, name of the solution.
- The `description` property is OPTIONAL, takes a `string` and represents a longer, non-technical and user-friendly, description of the solution.
- The `transactions` property is REQUIRED, takes an `array` of `Transaction` objects and represents one or more transactions needed for the user to execute the solution.
- The `deadline` property is OPTIONAL, takes a `number` and represents a unix timestamp by which this `Solution` should be executed. This is defined by the Orchestrator.

#### Transaction

```typescript
interface Transaction: {
    to: Destination; // REQUIRED
    chainId: number; // REQUIRED
    amount: (number|string); // REQUIRED
    calldata: string; // OPTIONAL
}
```

The above `Transaction` interface is a transaction definition that allows a wallet to perform their solution to a problem. There may be 1 or more transactions for a `Solution`.

- The `to` property is REQUIRED, takes a `Destination` type and represents the target for this Solution.
- The `chainId` property is REQUIRED, takes a number and represents the chain that this `Transaction` is targeted at. The `chainId` is REQUIRED here because the wallet MUST know where to send assets from as an origin due to the existence of multichain assets.
- The `amount` property is REQUIRED and represents the amount to be sent as part of the `Transaction`. Accepts either a `number`, which represents an ether unit, or a `string` which can be used for BigNumbers.

## Rationale

- Uses the Ethereum JSON-RPC JSON wrapper for greater compatibility.
- The interface definitions use only generic primitive types to ensure wide compatibility for any programming language.
- The interface definitions defined in this ERC attempts to cover as many scenarios as possible, from an Orchestrator perspective that a wallet may ask for, but focuses on core blockchain functionality.
- Certain high-level definitions, such as the `Problem` object definition, are sparse by design to allow space for future features introduced by other ERC's or network upgrades.
- Terminology is targeted towards a non-technical lexicon to aid in wider adoption and understanding.
- Nearly all options are REQUIRED, SHOULD and OPTIONAL to allow for both wallet and Orchestrator flexibility in providing solutions for the wallet request.
- It's understood that the Orchestrator interpretations and implementations will vary, so where possible the specification enforces REQUIRED and MUST to provide a universal level of service to an end-user or another service.
- The specification is **NOT** intended to standardise or modify the internal data structure or communication layer of an Orchestrator.
- Other parameters that could be considered, such as gas limits and estimations, are delegated back to the wallet as ultimately it is the wallet that will execute the solution(s).

## Backwards Compatibility

No backward compatibility issues found.

## Reference Implementation

### Example requests and responses for solutions

The following examples show a few common scenarios with their requests to, and from, an Orchestrator. All examples are chain abstracted (ChA¹) by default, unless specified.

  - with symbol USDC, amount 5

> [!NOTE]
> Notes: All requests for solutions should be chain abstracted (ChA¹) by default. The Orchestrator > > can check for 5 USDC on any chain for the above "from" address, and send a solution that receives > the 5 USDC on any other chain.

#### Calling a Smart Contract function on Polygon: Inscribing a message which costs 1 USDC

The following request performs an action:

- from 0xbafB4E1EFA94B359e2E175CF6156AedA2cACa165
- towards address 0x50840CE036eEf2005d3c4d6f6Eb65f8116a01629 on chain 137

## Security Considerations

### Orchestrator reputation

The ability for anyone to build an Orchestrator inherently brings the opportunity for code errors and therefore a degraded service. Orchestrators may also be abandoned over time. A reputation score should be leveraged by the Orchestrator to determine if the Orchestrator is fit for purpose. This should be up to the requesting system or wallet to determine.

### Orchestrator producing dishonest solutions

An Orchestrator may return transactions as part of a solution that are wrong or attempt to take more than what was asked of it. Where possible, the Orchestrator should validate returned transaction address destinations and any other data.

### Orchestrator personality variations

Whilst not a security consideration per-se, some Orchestrators may gravitate towards their own business targets which may skew the outcome of Orchestrator solutions. The systems or wallets requesting solutions from Orchestrators should be mindful of this unless it is intended.
