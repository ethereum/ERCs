## Abstract

The Composable NFTs utilizing equippable parts standard extends [ERC-721](./eip-721.md) by allowing the NFTs to selectively add parts to themselves via equipping.

Tokens can be composed by cherry picking the list of parts from a Catalog for each NFT instance, and are able to equip other NFTs into slots, which are also defined within the Catalog. Catalogs contain parts from which NFTs can be composed.

This proposal introduces two types of parts; slot type of parts and fixed type of parts. The slot type of parts allow for other NFT collections to be equipped into them, while fixed parts are full components with their own metadata.

Equipping a part into an NFT doesn't generate a new token, but rather adds another component to be rendered when retrieving the token.

## Motivation

With NFTs being a widespread form of tokens in the Ethereum ecosystem and being used for a variety of use cases, it is time to standardize additional utility for them. Having the ability for tokens to equip other tokens and be composed from a set of available parts allows for greater utility, usability and forward compatibility.

In the four years since [ERC-721](./eip-721.md) was published, the need for additional functionality has resulted in countless extensions. This EIP improves upon ERC-721 in the following areas:

- [Composing](#composing)
- [Token progression](#token-progression)
- [Merit tracking](#merit-tracking)
- [Provable Digital Scarcity](#provable-digital-scarcity)

### Composing

NFTs can work together to create a greater construct. Prior to this proposal, multiple NFTs could be composed into a single construct either by checking all of the compatible NFTs associated with a given account and used indiscriminately (which could result in unexpected result if there was more than one NFT intended to be used in the same slot), or by keeping a custom ledger of parts to compose together (either in a smart contract or an off-chain database). This proposal establishes a standardized framework for composable NFTs, where a single NFT can select which parts should be a part of the whole, with the information being on chain. Composing NFTs in such a way allows for virtually unbounded customization of the base NFT. An example of this could be a movie NFT. Some parts, like credits, should be fixed. Other parts, like scenes, should be interchangeable, so that various releases (base version, extended cuts, anniversary editions,...) can be replaced.

### Token progression

As the token progresses through various stages of its existence, it can attain or be awarded various parts. This can be explained in terms of gaming. A character could be represented by an NFT utilizing this proposal and would be able to equip gear acquired through the gameplay activities and as it progresses further in the game, better items would be available. In stead of having numerous NFTs representing the items collected through its progression, equippable parts can be unlocked and the NFT owner would be able to decide which items to equip and which to keep in the inventory (not equipped) without need of a centralized party.

### Merit tracking

An equippable NFT can also be used to track merit. An example of this is academic merit. The equippable NFT in this case would represent a sort of digital portfolio of academic achievements, where the owner would be able to equip their diplomas, published articles and awards for all to see.

### Provable Digital Scarcity

The majority of current NFT projects are only mock-scarce. Even with a limited supply of tokens, the utility of these (if any) is uncapped. As an example, you can log into 500 different instances of the same game using the same wallet and the same NFT. You can then equip the same hat onto 500 different in-game avatars at the same time, because its visual representation is just a client-side mechanic. 

This proposal adds the ability to enforce that, if a hat is equipped on one avatar (by being sent into it and then equipped), it cannot be equipped on another. This provides real digital scarcity.

## Specification

The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

## Rationale

Designing the proposal, we considered the following questions:

1. **Why are we using a Catalog in stead of supporting direct NFT equipping?**\
If NFTs could be directly equipped into other NFTs without any oversight, the resulting composite would be unpredictable. Catalog allows for parts to be pre-verified in order to result in a composite that composes as expected. Another benefit of Catalog is the ability of defining reusable fixed parts.
2. **Why do we propose two types of parts?**\
Some parts, that are the same for all of the tokens, don't make sense to be represented by individual NFTs, so they can be represented by fixed parts. This reduces the clutter of the owner's wallet as well as introduces an efficient way of disseminating repetitive assets tied to NFTs.\
The slot parts allow for equipping NFTs into them. This provides the ability to equip unrelated NFT collections into the base NFT after the unrelated collection has been verified to compose properly.\
Having two parts allows for support of numerous use cases and, since the proposal doesn't enforce the use of both it can be applied in any configuration needed.
3. **Why is a method to get all of the equipped parts not included?**\
Getting all parts might not be an operation necessary for all implementers. Additionally, it can be added either as an extension, doable with hooks, or can be emulated using an indexer.
4. **Should Catalog be limited to support one NFT collection at a time or be able to support any nunmber of collections?**\
As the Catalog is designed in a way that is agnostic to the use case using it. It makes sense to support as wide reusability as possible. Having one Catalog supporting multiple collections allows for optimized operation and reduced gas prices when deploying it and setting fixed as well as slot parts.

### Fixed parts

Fixed parts are defined and contained in the Catalog. They have their own metadata and are not meant to change through the lifecycle of the NFT. 

A fixed part cannot be replaced.

The benefit of fixed parts is that they represent equippable parts that can be equipped by any number of tokens in any number of collections and only need to be defined once.

### Slot parts

Slot parts are defined and contained in the Catalog. They don't have their own metadata, but rather support equipping of selected NFT collections into them. The tokens equipped into the slots however, contain their own metadata. This allows for an equippable modifialbe content of the base NFT controlled by its owner. As they can be equipped into any number of tokens of any number of collections, they allow for reliable composing of the final tokens by vetting which NFTs can be equipped by a given slot once and then reused any number of times.

## Backwards Compatibility

The Equippable token standard has been made compatible with [ERC-721](./eip-721.md) in order to take advantage of the robust tooling available for implementations of ERC-721 and to ensure compatibility with existing ERC-721 infrastructure.

## Test Cases

Tests are included in [`equippableFixedParts.ts`](../assets/eip-6220/test/equippableFixedParts.ts) and [`equippableSlotParts.ts`](../assets/eip-6220/test/equippableSlotParts.ts).

To run them in terminal, you can use the following commands:

```
cd ../assets/eip-6220
npm install
npx hardhat test
```

## Reference Implementation

See [`EquippableToken.sol`](../assets/eip-6220/contracts/EquippableToken.sol).


## Security Considerations

The same security considerations as with [ERC-721](./eip-721.md) apply: hidden logic may be present in any of the functions, including burn, add resource, accept resource, and more.

Caution is advised when dealing with non-audited contracts.
