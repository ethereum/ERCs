## Abstract

This ERC proposes a decentralized employment system (DES) built on the Ethereum blockchain. The system records employment history, allows users to found new companies, facilitates labor contracts, automates salary payments, incorporates a moderation mechanism for dispute resolution, and includes a review system for both companies and employees. All employment history is public, ensuring transparency and accountability in the employment process. 

It must be noted that this system comes into play after the company tests the employee, the employee passes these tests, and before hiring and signing the labor contract. The employee uses their employee token, which contains their employment history, and the company checks the history before finalizing the labor contract.

## Motivation

Traditional employment systems are centralized, opaque, and often lack trust. The DES aims to bring transparency, immutability, and trust to employment by leveraging blockchain technology. By recording employment history on-chain, enabling decentralized company creation, automating contract enforcement, and adding moderation for dispute resolution, the DES promotes a fairer and more transparent employment ecosystem. This system also streamlines the final steps of hiring, following testing phases, making the contract phase smoother and more secure.

## Specification

### Company Creation

1. **Company Registration**: Users can register new companies on the blockchain. Each company is a unique entity with its own address.
2. **Company Profile**: The company profile includes details like name, industry, and a list of registered employees.

### Labor Contracts

1. **Contract Creation**: Once the company has tested the employee and is ready to move forward with the final hiring stage, companies can create a labor contract by calling the `createContract(uint companyId, uint employeeTokenId, uint salary, uint duration, string responsibilities, string terminationConditions)` function. This function generates a unique `contractId` and stores it in a `contracts` mapping, associating each contract with a `companyId`.
   - The employee will handle their **employee token** (minted prior to employment) to the company, and the company will review the token’s employment history before proceeding with the contract.
  
2. **Employee Tokenization**: Employees are represented as unique tokens (e.g., an NFT) minted by the contract owner. Employees must possess this token before being hired by any company. The token contains metadata about the employee (e.g., professional credentials) and plays a crucial role in salary payments and employment history tracking.
   - The employee token is linked to the employee's work history, which the company can check before the contract is signed. This process may take place after the employee is discovered and tested via platforms like LinkedIn or other means.
   - The employee token’s owner (the employee) will be the designated recipient of salary payments within the escrow system.

3. **Contract Execution**: The `executeContract(uint contractId)` function sets the contract status to "active" once both parties (company and employee) have agreed by signing the transaction with their respective wallets.

### Employment History

1. **Immutable Records**: Employment history is stored as an array of contract IDs in an `employmentHistory` mapping, keyed by the employee’s token ID. This ensures that an employee's history is permanently recorded on the blockchain. The function `getEmploymentHistory(uint employeeTokenId)` allows the company to fetch the complete employment history of an employee before finalizing the contract.

2. **Public Accessibility**: The employment history data is publicly accessible through the `employmentHistory` mapping and can be queried using `getEmploymentHistory`.

### Payment System

1. **Salary Deposits**: Companies are required to call `depositSalary(uint contractId)` and transfer the salary amount to the smart contract's escrow. The deposited amount is tracked in an `escrowBalances` mapping.

2. **Automated Payments**: The `releaseSalary(uint contractId)` function can be called by the contract itself (automated) or the employee token owner to release the salary according to the payment schedule. The smart contract ensures that the payment conditions (e.g., time period, contract completion) are met before transferring the funds from escrow to the employee's address.

### Moderation and Dispute Resolution

1. **Dispute Initiation**: Either party (company or employee) can initiate a dispute by calling `raiseDispute(uint contractId)`. This function triggers the assignment of a moderator to resolve the issue.

2. **Moderator Assignment**: Moderators are assigned to each contract at the time of creation. The moderator mediates any disputes between the company and the employee, including issues such as salary payments or contract termination. Moderators can be decentralized entities or trusted third parties.

3. **Dispute Resolution**: The assigned moderator can resolve disputes through the `resolveDispute(uint contractId, bool decisionForEmployee)` function. If the moderator rules in favor of the employee, the escrow funds are transferred to the employee token’s owner. If the company’s side prevails, the funds may be returned to the company.

### Firing Employees

1. **Termination Conditions**: The `terminateContract(uint contractId, string reason)` function can be called by the company if the termination conditions outlined in the contract are met. The function sets the contract status to "terminated."
2. **Moderator's Role in Termination**: In the case of disputes regarding termination, the moderator is called upon to resolve the issue based on the contract terms and evidence provided by both parties.

### Review System

1. **Reputation Scores**: Both companies and employees can submit reviews using the `submitReview(uint contractId, uint rating, string comments)` function. These reviews are stored in a `reviews` mapping and tied to the contract ID.

2. **Public Reviews**: Reviews can be accessed using `getReviews(uint contractId)`, which returns an array of reviews associated with a specific contract. These reviews contribute to a reputation score for both the company and employee.

## Rationale

1. **Employee Tokenization**: 
   - The decision to use tokens (NFTs) to represent employees was made to ensure that each employee has a unique, verifiable identity on the blockchain. This allows for the tracking of employment history in a decentralized, tamper-proof manner. It also allows companies to review an employee's history before finalizing the labor contract, ensuring transparency.

2. **Escrow System for Salary Payments**: 
   - By using an escrow system, the DES ensures that salary payments are secured before work begins, and funds are only released when agreed-upon conditions are met. This protects both parties, giving employees confidence that their salaries are secured, and giving companies assurance that payments will only be released after work is completed.

3. **Moderation and Dispute Resolution**: 
   - The moderation mechanism was included to handle disputes that cannot be automatically resolved by the smart contract. While smart contracts can enforce straightforward conditions, human intervention is sometimes necessary in complex employment matters such as disagreements over contract fulfillment or termination. The moderator acts as an impartial arbitrator in such cases.

4. **Public Employment History**:
   - Making employment history public allows for increased trust and transparency in the system. Potential employers can verify the legitimacy of past employment, and employees can build a verifiable reputation over time. This design choice reduces the potential for fraud and misinformation.

5. **Review System**:
   - The inclusion of a public review system allows for mutual accountability between companies and employees. Reviews help maintain a transparent record of performance and experiences, contributing to the overall trust and fairness of the ecosystem. Public reviews also play a role in reputation-building, encouraging better behavior from both employers and employees.

## Test Cases

1. **Company Creation**: Test the registration and profile creation for new companies.
2. **Contract Creation and Signing**: Test the creation of a labor contract and the signing process by both parties.
3. **Salary Payment**: Test the salary deposit and automated payment system.
4. **Dispute Resolution**: Test the moderation system for resolving salary and termination disputes.
5. **Employment Termination**: Test the conditions for employee termination and the associated smart contract enforcement.

## Security Considerations

1. **Contract Integrity**: Ensure the labor contracts are immutable and tamper-proof.
2. **Fund Security**: Ensure salary deposits are securely held in escrow until payment conditions are met.
3. **Moderator Trust**: Implement a system for selecting and monitoring moderators to ensure fair dispute resolutions.
4. **Review System**: Safeguard against fraudulent reviews and ensure the accuracy of reputation scores.
