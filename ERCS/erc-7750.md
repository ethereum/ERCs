## Abstract

This ERC proposes a decentralized employment system (DES) built on the Ethereum blockchain. The system records employment history, allows users to found new companies, facilitates labor contracts, automates salary payments, and includes a review system for both companies and employees. All employment history is public, ensuring transparency and accountability in the employment process.

## Motivation

Traditional employment systems are centralized, opaque, and often lack trust. The DES aims to bring transparency, immutability, and trust to employment by leveraging blockchain technology. By recording employment history on-chain, enabling decentralized company creation, and automating contract enforcement, the DES promotes a fairer and more transparent employment ecosystem.

## Specification

### Company Creation

1. **Company Registration**: Users can register new companies on the blockchain. Each company is a unique entity with its own address.
2. **Company Profile**: The company profile includes details like name, industry, and a list of registered employees.

### Labor Contracts

1. **Contract Creation**: Companies can create a labor contract by calling the createContract(uint companyId, address employee, uint salary, uint duration, string responsibilities, string terminationConditions) function.
This function generates a unique contractId and stores it in a contracts mapping where each contract is associated with a companyId.
2. **Employee Tokenization**: Each employee is represented as a unique token (e.g., an NFT) that is associated with their employment within the company.
When an employee is hired, the company can call mintEmployeeToken(address employee, uint companyId) to create an NFT representing the employee's role and association with the company.
The NFT is transferred to the employee's address and serves as a digital representation of their employment within the organization, containing metadata such as their job title, start date, and other relevant employment details.
3. **Contract Execution**: The executeContract(uint contractId) function sets the contract status to "active" once both parties (company and employee) have agreed by signing the transaction with their respective wallets.

### Employment History

1. **Immutable Records**: Employment history is stored as an array of contract IDs in an employmentHistory mapping, keyed by the employee’s address. This ensures that an employee's history is permanently recorded on the blockchain.
The function getEmploymentHistory(address employee) allows fetching an employee's complete employment history.
2. **Public Accessibility**: The employment history data is publicly accessible through the employmentHistory mapping and can be queried using getEmploymentHistory.

### Payment System

1. **Salary Deposits**: Companies are required to call depositSalary(uint contractId) and transfer the salary amount to the smart contract's balance. The deposited amount is tracked in an escrow mapping.
2. **Automated Payments**: The releaseSalary(uint contractId) function can be called by the contract itself (automated) or the employee to release the salary according to the payment schedule. The smart contract checks that the conditions (e.g., time period) are met before transferring the funds from escrow to the employee's address.

### Firing Employees

1. **Termination Conditions**: The terminateContract(uint contractId, string reason) function can be called by the company if the termination conditions in the contract are met. The function sets the contract status to "terminated."
2. **Dispute Resolution**: In case of disputes, either party can call raiseDispute(uint contractId, string details) which emits an event DisputeRaised for off-chain arbitration or integration with decentralized arbitration services like Kleros.

### Review System

1. **Reputation Scores**: Companies and employees can leave reviews via the submitReview(uint contractId, uint rating, string comments) function.
The reviews are stored in a reviews mapping, which is keyed by the contractId and includes the rating, comments, and reviewer’s address.
2. **Public Reviews**: Reviews can be accessed using getReviews(uint contractId) which returns an array of reviews associated with a specific contract. These reviews contribute to the reputation score, which can be calculated as an average rating over all contracts associated with the company or employee.


## Rationale

The DES is designed to create a fair, transparent, and secure employment ecosystem. By recording employment history on-chain, automating contract enforcement, and providing a public review system, DES addresses many of the shortcomings of traditional employment systems.


## Test Cases

1. **Company Creation**: Test the registration and profile creation for new companies.
2. **Contract Creation and Signing**: Test the creation of a labor contract and the signing process by both parties.
3. **Salary Payment**: Test the salary deposit and automated payment system.
4. **Employment Termination**: Test the conditions for employee termination and the associated smart contract enforcement.

## Security Considerations

1. **Contract Integrity**: Ensure the labor contracts are immutable and tamper-proof.
2. **Fund Security**: Ensure salary deposits are securely held in escrow until payment conditions are met.
3. **Review System**: Implement safeguards to prevent fraudulent reviews and ensure the accuracy of reputation scores.
