## Abstract

This ERC proposes a Decentralized Employment System (DES) built on the Ethereum blockchain. The DES facilitates the creation and management of companies, records comprehensive employment histories through unique employee tokens, enables the formation and execution of labor contracts, automates salary payments via an escrow mechanism, incorporates a robust moderation system for dispute resolution, and implements a reputation-based review system for both employers and employees. By leveraging blockchain's transparency and immutability, the DES ensures accountability and trust throughout the employment lifecycle, from company creation and hiring to contract fulfillment and termination.

The system operates post employee testing and prior to the final hiring and contract signing. Employees possess a **Soulbound Token (SBT)** representing their employment history, which companies review before finalizing labor contracts. This token-based approach ensures a secure and verifiable employment record that enhances the hiring process's integrity.

## Motivation

Traditional employment systems are centralized, opaque, and often lack trust. The DES aims to introduce transparency, immutability, and trust into the employment process by leveraging blockchain technology. By recording employment history on-chain, enabling decentralized company creation, automating contract enforcement, and providing mechanisms for dispute resolution, the DES promotes a fairer and more transparent employment ecosystem. Additionally, the system streamlines the hiring process by securely managing employment records and automating contractual obligations.

## Specification

### Solidity Interface

To provide a clear and standardized way for developers to interact with the DES, the following Solidity interface outlines the primary functions and events of the system:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

/// @title Decentralized Employment System Interface
interface IDecentralizedEmploymentSystem {
    
    // Events
    event CompanyRegistered(uint companyId, address owner, string name, string industry);
    event EmployeeTokenMinted(uint tokenId, address employee);
    event ContractCreated(uint contractId, uint companyId, uint employeeTokenId, uint salary, uint duration);
    event ContractExecuted(uint contractId);
    event SalaryDeposited(uint contractId, uint amount);
    event SalaryReleased(uint contractId, address employee);
    event DisputeRaised(uint contractId, address raisedBy);
    event DisputeResolved(uint contractId, bool decisionForEmployee);
    event ContractTerminated(uint contractId, string reason);
    event ReviewSubmitted(uint contractId, uint rating, string comments);
    
    // Company Management
    function registerCompany(string calldata name, string calldata industry) external returns (uint companyId);
    function getCompany(uint companyId) external view returns (string memory name, string memory industry, address owner, uint[] memory employeeIds);
    
    // Employee Management
    function mintEmployeeToken(address employee, string calldata metadataURI) external returns (uint tokenId);

    // Labor Contracts
    function createContract(uint companyId, uint employeeTokenId, uint salary, uint duration, string calldata responsibilities, string calldata terminationConditions) external returns (uint contractId);
    function executeContract(uint contractId) external;
    
    // Payment System
    function depositSalary(uint contractId) external payable;
    function releaseSalary(uint contractId) external;
    
    // Dispute Resolution
    function raiseDispute(uint contractId) external;
    function resolveDispute(uint contractId, bool decisionForEmployee) external;
    
    // Contract Termination
    function terminateContract(uint contractId, string calldata reason) external;

### Employment History

1. **Immutable Records**: Employment history is maintained as an array of contract IDs linked to each employee's Soulbound Token (SBT). This ensures that all employment records are permanently and immutably stored on the blockchain.

2. **Public Accessibility**: Employment history data is publicly accessible through the `getEmploymentHistory` function, allowing companies to verify an employee's past engagements before finalizing contracts.

### Payment System

1. **Salary Deposits**: Companies deposit salaries into an escrow managed by the smart contract by calling `depositSalary`. The contract ensures that funds are securely held until payment conditions are satisfied.

2. **Automated Payments**: Salaries are released automatically or upon triggering the `releaseSalary` function, ensuring timely and condition-based payments to employees.

### Moderation and Dispute Resolution

1. **Dispute Initiation and Resolution**: Either party can raise disputes, which are then resolved by assigned moderators. Moderators act as impartial arbitrators to ensure fair outcomes based on contract terms and evidence provided.

### Firing Employees

1. **Termination Conditions**: Companies can terminate contracts based on predefined conditions, with the option for dispute resolution if termination is contested.

### Review System

1. **Reputation Scores**: Reviews contribute to the reputation scores of both companies and employees, fostering accountability and encouraging positive behavior within the ecosystem.

## Rationale

1. **Employee Tokenization**:
   - Utilizing **Soulbound Tokens (SBTs)** to represent employees ensures that each employee has a unique, non-transferable identity on the blockchain. This design choice enhances the integrity of employment records, making them tamper-proof and verifiable. It also allows companies to access a comprehensive employment history before finalizing contracts, promoting transparency.

2. **Escrow System for Salary Payments**:
   - Implementing an escrow mechanism secures salary payments, ensuring that funds are only released when contractual obligations are met. This system protects both employees and companies by guaranteeing that salaries are available and that payments are contingent on contract fulfillment.

3. **Moderation and Dispute Resolution**:
   - Incorporating a moderation system allows for the resolution of disputes that cannot be automatically enforced by smart contracts. Moderators provide necessary human oversight in complex employment matters, ensuring fair and just outcomes.

4. **Public Employment History**:
   - Making employment history publicly accessible fosters trust and accountability. It allows potential employers to verify past employment and credentials, reducing the risk of fraud and enhancing the credibility of employees within the ecosystem.

5. **Review System**:
   - A reputation-based review system encourages positive interactions and behaviors among users. By allowing both companies and employees to submit reviews, the system promotes mutual accountability and helps build reliable reputations.

## Test Cases

1. **Company Creation**

   **Input**  
   - A user calls `registerCompany("TechCorp", "Technology")`.
   
   **Expected State Changes**  
   - A new `companyId` is generated (e.g., `companyId = 1`).
   - The `companies` mapping is updated:
  ```solidity
     companies[1]↦{
      name="TechCorp",
      industry="Technology",
      owner=callerAddress,
      employeeIds=[ ]
      }
  ```
   - An event `CompanyRegistered` is emitted with the arguments `(1, callerAddress, "TechCorp", "Technology")`.

   **Expected Output**  
   - **Return Value**: `companyId = 1` (the newly created company ID).
   - **Event**: `CompanyRegistered` is logged.

2. **Employee Token Minting**

   **Input**  
   - The contract owner (or an authorized address) calls `mintEmployeeToken(employeeAddress, "ipfs://metadataURI")`.
   
   **Expected State Changes**  
   - A new token ID is generated (e.g., `tokenId = 5`).
   - An internal mapping (e.g., `employeeTokenToOwner`) is updated:
   ```solidity
      employeeTokenToOwner[5]↦employeeAddress
   ```
   - (Optional) If the implementation tracks metadata, another mapping (e.g., `employeeTokenMetadata`) might store:
   ```solidity
      employeeTokenMetadata[5]↦"ipfs://metadataURI"
   ```
   - An event `EmployeeTokenMinted` is emitted with `(5, employeeAddress)`.

   **Expected Output**  
   - **Return Value**: `tokenId = 5` (the newly minted employee token ID).
   - **Event**: `EmployeeTokenMinted` is logged.

3. **Contract Creation and Execution**

   **Input**  
   1. A company with `companyId = 1` calls:
   ```solidity
      createContract(1,5,1000,6,"SoftwareDevelopment","Failuretomeetdeadlines")
   ```
   which returns `contractId`.
   2. Both the company and the employee call `executeContract(contractId)`.

   **Expected State Changes**  
   - **Contract Creation**:
     1. A new labor contract ID is generated, e.g., `contractId = 10`.
     2. The `contracts` mapping is updated:
     ```solidity
        contracts[10]↦{
          companyId=1,
          employeeTokenId=5,
          salary=1000,
          duration=6,
          responsibilities="SoftwareDevelopment",
          terminationConditions="Failuretomeetdeadlines",status="Created"
        }
     ```
     3. The system may also update a per-company or per-employee tracking structure (optional but typical):
     ```solidity
        companyContracts[1].push(10)
        employeeContracts[5].push(10)
     ```
     4. An event `ContractCreated` is emitted with arguments `(10, 1, 5, 1000, 6)`.
   - **Contract Execution**:
     1. Upon calls from both parties, the contract’s status changes from `"Created"` to `"Active"`:
     ```solidity
        contracts[10].status↦"Active"
     ```
     2. An event `ContractExecuted` is emitted with `(10)` once both signatures/confirmations are received.

   **Expected Output**  
   - **Return Value** (from `createContract`): `contractId = 10`
   - **Event**: `ContractCreated(10, 1, 5, 1000, 6)` upon creation.
   - **Event**: `ContractExecuted(10)` once execution is confirmed by both parties.

4. **Salary Deposit**

   **Input**  
   - The company (owner of `companyId = 1`) calls `depositSalary(10)` and sends `1000 USDC` (or equivalent in wei for an [ERC-20](./eip-20.md) token or native token) to the contract.

   **Expected State Changes**  
   1. The contract’s escrow balance mapping is updated:
   ```solidity
      escrowBalances[10]↦1000
   ```
   2. An event `SalaryDeposited` is emitted with `(10, 1000)`.

   **Expected Output**  
   - **Event**: `SalaryDeposited(10, 1000)`
   - The contract’s internal `escrowBalances[10]` should now be `1000`.

5. **Salary Payment**

   **Input**  
   - After the contract’s duration or satisfaction of any release condition, `releaseSalary(10)` is called (by the contract or the employee).

   **Expected State Changes**  
   1. The escrow balance for `contractId = 10` is transferred to the employee token owner (`employeeAddress` associated with token ID `5`).
   2. The `escrowBalances[10]` is set to `0`:
   ```solidity
      escrowBalances[10]↦0
   ```
   3. An event `SalaryReleased` is emitted with `(10, employeeAddress)`.

   **Expected Output**  
   - **Event**: `SalaryReleased(10, employeeAddress)`
   - The updated `escrowBalances[10]` is now `0`.
   - The employee’s on-chain balance (or token balance if using [ERC-20](./eip-20.md)) increases by `1000`.

6. **Employment Termination**

   **Input**  
   - The company calls `terminateContract(10, "Failure to meet deadlines")`.

   **Expected State Changes**  
   1. The `contracts[10].status` is updated to `"Terminated"`:
   ```solidity
      contracts[10].status↦"Terminated"
   ```
   2. An event `ContractTerminated` is emitted with `(10, "Failure to meet deadlines")`.

   **Expected Output**  
   - **Event**: `ContractTerminated(10, "Failure to meet deadlines")`
   - The `contracts[10]` status is now `"Terminated"`.
   - No further salary obligations exist unless otherwise specified in dispute-resolution processes.

7. **Dispute Resolution**

   **Input**  
   1. Either party (company or employee) calls `raiseDispute(10)`.
   2. The assigned moderator calls `resolveDispute(10, true)` indicating the decision favors the employee.

   **Expected State Changes**  
   - **Dispute Raised**:
     1. The contract’s dispute status is noted (implementation-specific, but typically `contracts[10].disputeRaised = true`).
     2. An event `DisputeRaised(10, msg.sender)` is emitted.
   - **Dispute Resolved**:
     1. If `decisionForEmployee == true`, any remaining escrow funds for `contractId = 10` are transferred to the employee.
     2. A `DisputeResolved(10, true)` event is emitted.

   **Expected Output**  
   - **Event**: `DisputeRaised(10, msg.sender)`
   - **Event**: `DisputeResolved(10, true)`
   - If funds remain in escrow, `escrowBalances[10]` is set to `0`, and the employee receives the outstanding balance.


## Security Considerations

1. **Contract Integrity**: Ensure that all labor contracts are immutable and cannot be tampered with once created and executed.

2. **Fund Security**: Salaries are securely held in escrow, and only released based on predefined conditions to prevent unauthorized access or misuse.

3. **Moderator Trust**: Implement a decentralized and transparent system for selecting and monitoring moderators to maintain impartiality and trust in dispute resolutions.

4. **Review System**: Incorporate safeguards against fraudulent reviews, such as verifying the association of reviews with legitimate contract completions, to maintain accurate and trustworthy reputation scores.

5. **Token Security**: Use **Soulbound Tokens (SBTs)** for employee representation to prevent token transfers and ensure that employment records are securely tied to the respective individuals.
