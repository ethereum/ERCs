## Abstract

This ERC proposes a Decentralized Employment System (DES) built on the Ethereum blockchain. The DES facilitates the creation and management of companies, records comprehensive employment histories through unique employee tokens, enables the formation and execution of labor contracts, automates salary payments via an escrow mechanism, incorporates a robust moderation system for dispute resolution, and implements a reputation-based review system for both employers and employees. By leveraging blockchain's transparency and immutability, the DES ensures accountability and trust throughout the employment lifecycle, from company creation and hiring to contract fulfillment and termination.

The system operates post employee testing and prior to the final hiring and contract signing. Employees possess a **Soulbound Token (SBT)** representing their employment history, which companies review before finalizing labor contracts. This token-based approach ensures a secure and verifiable employment record that enhances the hiring process's integrity.

## Motivation

Traditional employment systems are centralized, opaque, and often lack trust. The DES aims to introduce transparency, immutability, and trust into the employment process by leveraging blockchain technology. By recording employment history on-chain, enabling decentralized company creation, automating contract enforcement, and providing mechanisms for dispute resolution, the DES promotes a fairer and more transparent employment ecosystem. Additionally, the system streamlines the hiring process by securely managing employment records and automating contractual obligations.

## Specification

### Solidity Interface

To provide a clear and standardized way for developers to interact with the DES, the following Solidity interface outlines the primary functions and events of the system:

```solidity

### Employment History

1. **Immutable Records**: Employment history is maintained as an array of contract IDs linked to each employee's Soulbound Token (SBT). This ensures that all employment records are permanently and immutably stored on the blockchain.

2. **Public Accessibility**: Employment history data is publicly accessible through the `getEmploymentHistory` function, allowing companies to verify an employee's past engagements before finalizing contracts.

### Payment System

1. **Salary Deposits**: Companies deposit salaries into an escrow managed by the smart contract by calling `depositSalary`. The contract ensures that funds are securely held until payment conditions are satisfied.

2. **Automated Payments**: Salaries are released automatically or upon triggering the `releaseSalary` function, ensuring timely and condition-based payments to employees.

### Moderation and Dispute Resolution

1. **Dispute Initiation and Resolution**: Either party can raise disputes, which are then resolved by assigned moderators. Moderators act as impartial arbitrators to ensure fair outcomes based on contract terms and evidence provided.

### Firing Employees

1. **Termination Conditions**: Companies can terminate contracts based on predefined conditions, with the option for dispute resolution if termination is contested.

### Review System

1. **Reputation Scores**: Reviews contribute to the reputation scores of both companies and employees, fostering accountability and encouraging positive behavior within the ecosystem.

## Rationale

1. **Employee Tokenization**:
   - Utilizing **Soulbound Tokens (SBTs)** to represent employees ensures that each employee has a unique, non-transferable identity on the blockchain. This design choice enhances the integrity of employment records, making them tamper-proof and verifiable. It also allows companies to access a comprehensive employment history before finalizing contracts, promoting transparency.

2. **Escrow System for Salary Payments**:
   - Implementing an escrow mechanism secures salary payments, ensuring that funds are only released when contractual obligations are met. This system protects both employees and companies by guaranteeing that salaries are available and that payments are contingent on contract fulfillment.

3. **Moderation and Dispute Resolution**:
   - Incorporating a moderation system allows for the resolution of disputes that cannot be automatically enforced by smart contracts. Moderators provide necessary human oversight in complex employment matters, ensuring fair and just outcomes.

4. **Public Employment History**:
   - Making employment history publicly accessible fosters trust and accountability. It allows potential employers to verify past employment and credentials, reducing the risk of fraud and enhancing the credibility of employees within the ecosystem.

5. **Review System**:
   - A reputation-based review system encourages positive interactions and behaviors among users. By allowing both companies and employees to submit reviews, the system promotes mutual accountability and helps build reliable reputations.

## Test Cases

1. **Company Creation**:
   - **Input**: A user calls the `registerCompany("TechCorp", "Technology")` function.
   - **Expected Output**: A new company is registered with a unique `companyId`, and the `companies` mapping is updated with the company's details (name: "TechCorp", industry: "Technology", owner: caller's address).

2. **Employee Token Minting**:
   - **Input**: The system owner calls `mintEmployeeToken(employeeAddress, "ipfs://metadataURI")`.
   - **Expected Output**: A new SBT is minted for the employee with a unique `tokenId`, and the `employees` mapping is updated accordingly.

3. **Contract Creation and Execution**:
   - **Input**:
     1. A company with `companyId` `1` calls `createContract(1, 5, 1000, 6, "Software Development", "Failure to meet deadlines")`.
     2. Both the company and the employee sign the contract by calling `executeContract(contractId)`.
   - **Expected Output**:
     1. A new labor contract is created with a unique `contractId`, and relevant mappings are updated.
     2. The contract status is set to "active" upon execution by both parties.

4. **Salary Deposit**:
   - **Input**: The company calls `depositSalary(contractId)` with a value of `1000 USDC`.
   - **Expected Output**: The `escrowBalances` mapping is updated to reflect the deposited amount for `contractId`, securing the funds in escrow.

5. **Salary Payment**:
   - **Input**: After the contract duration, `releaseSalary(contractId)` is called.
   - **Expected Output**: The escrowed `1000 USDC` is transferred to the employee's address, and the `escrowBalances` mapping for `contractId` is reset to zero.

6. **Employment Termination**:
   - **Input**: The company calls `terminateContract(contractId, "Failure to meet deadlines")`.
   - **Expected Output**:
     1. The contract status is updated to "terminated" in the `contracts` mapping.
     2. A termination event is emitted, and the company is no longer obligated to continue salary payments.

7. **Dispute Resolution**:
   - **Input**: Either party calls `raiseDispute(contractId)`, followed by the assigned moderator calling `resolveDispute(contractId, true)` to favor the employee.
   - **Expected Output**: The escrow funds are transferred to the employee, and the dispute is marked as resolved in the contract's status.

## Security Considerations

1. **Contract Integrity**: Ensure that all labor contracts are immutable and cannot be tampered with once created and executed.

2. **Fund Security**: Salaries are securely held in escrow, and only released based on predefined conditions to prevent unauthorized access or misuse.

3. **Moderator Trust**: Implement a decentralized and transparent system for selecting and monitoring moderators to maintain impartiality and trust in dispute resolutions.

4. **Review System**: Incorporate safeguards against fraudulent reviews, such as verifying the association of reviews with legitimate contract completions, to maintain accurate and trustworthy reputation scores.

5. **Token Security**: Use **Soulbound Tokens (SBTs)** for employee representation to prevent token transfers and ensure that employment records are securely tied to the respective individuals.
