## Abstract

This ERC proposes a decentralized employment system (DES) built on the Ethereum blockchain. The system records employment history, allows users to found new companies, facilitates labor contracts, automates salary payments, and includes a review system for both companies and employees. All employment history is public, ensuring transparency and accountability in the employment process.

## Motivation

Traditional employment systems are centralized, opaque, and often lack trust. The DES aims to bring transparency, immutability, and trust to employment by leveraging blockchain technology. By recording employment history on-chain, enabling decentralized company creation, and automating contract enforcement, the DES promotes a fairer and more transparent employment ecosystem.

## Specification

### Company Creation

1. **Company Registration**: Users can register new companies on the blockchain. Each company is a unique entity with its own address.
2. **Company Profile**: The company profile includes details like name, industry, and a list of registered employees.

### Labor Contracts

1. **Contract Creation**: A standardized labor contract is created between the company and the employee. The contract includes terms like salary, duration, responsibilities, and termination conditions.
2. **Contract Tokenization**: Each contract is represented as a unique token (e.g., an NFT) that is signed by both the company and the employee.
3. **Contract Execution**: The contract is enforced by the smart contract, ensuring compliance with the agreed terms.

### Employment History

1. **Immutable Records**: Employment history is recorded on the blockchain, creating an immutable record of a personâ€™s employment journey.
2. **Public Accessibility**: All employment histories are public and can be accessed by anyone, promoting transparency.

### Payment System

1. **Salary Deposits**: Companies must deposit salary funds into the contract as per the agreed terms. These funds are held in escrow until payment conditions are met.
2. **Automated Payments**: The smart contract automates salary payments according to the contract terms, ensuring timely and accurate payments.

### Firing Employees

1. **Termination Conditions**: The contract specifies conditions under which the company can terminate an employee. These conditions are enforced by the smart contract.
2. **Dispute Resolution**: A decentralized dispute resolution mechanism can be integrated to handle disagreements between companies and employees.

### Review System

1. **Reputation Scores**: Both companies and employees can receive and give reviews. These reviews are stored on-chain and contribute to a reputation score.
2. **Public Reviews**: Reviews are public and accessible to all users, fostering accountability and trust in the system.

## Rationale

The DES is designed to create a fair, transparent, and secure employment ecosystem. By recording employment history on-chain, automating contract enforcement, and providing a public review system, DES addresses many of the shortcomings of traditional employment systems.


## Test Cases

1. **Company Creation**: Test the registration and profile creation for new companies.
2. **Contract Creation and Signing**: Test the creation of a labor contract and the signing process by both parties.
3. **Salary Payment**: Test the salary deposit and automated payment system.
4. **Employment Termination**: Test the conditions for employee termination and the associated smart contract enforcement.

## Security Considerations

1. **Contract Integrity**: Ensure the labor contracts are immutable and tamper-proof.
2. **Fund Security**: Ensure salary deposits are securely held in escrow until payment conditions are met.
3. **Review System**: Implement safeguards to prevent fraudulent reviews and ensure the accuracy of reputation scores.
