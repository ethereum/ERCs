## Abstract

An ERC token standard representing shares in a corporation. This new interface standardizes equity management for issuers, investors, transfer agents, and financial intermediaries.

## Motivation

Creating a standard for corporation requires an industry effort. That's why this token standard adheres to the same design principles as the Open Cap Format (OCF), an industry-approved data standard for cap tables. Now everyone can adopt the same OCF-compliant token standard for Ethereum and beyond!

## Specification

> The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.

MUST NOT use [ERC-20](./eip-20.md) methods, which have breaking changes.

SHOULD use `addShareClass(bytes32 name, string uri)` to create at least one share class before minting tokens.

SHOULD use `balanceOf(address user)` to get a holder's total share count, incuding all share classes.

SHOULD use `balanceOf(address user, string name)` to lookup a holder's balance by the specified share class name.

SHOULD use `totalSupply()` to get the total outstanding share count, incuding all share classes.

SHOULD use `totalSupply(string name)` to lookup outstanding shares by the specified class name.

SHOULD use `securities(bytes32 securityId)` to fetch individual security details.

MAY assign a `uri` when creating a share class that points to a JSON file containing relevant metadata.

MAY specify a value of `0` for `startTime`, `cliffTime`, and `duration` parameters in `issue` for stock issuances without a vesting condition.

This standard is not backwards compatible with [ERC-20](./eip-20.md) nor [ERC-3643](./eip-3643.md) since it generates a unique security ID for each transfer and issuance. Mint and burn methods have been renamed to issue and cancel. The security ID provides a unique identifier for every balance resulting from an issuance operation and for every residual and/or resulting balances from a transfer operation.

Furthermore, vesting and governing documentation are separate concerns not addressed in this standard, requiring their own companion ERCs. For now the vesting parameters in the `issue` method are temporary until a vesting spec is formalized. A vesting and governing document contract should be linked to the equity token. This approach is being taken to cut down on the equity token contract bytesize.

Every compliant contract must implement this interface:

## Rationale

Assigning a unique `securityId` to all issuances of equity tokens is the industry-accepted practice for assignment of unique vesting conditions, audit, and cost-basis tracking purposes. To keep the implementation under the max size limit, vesting conditions and governing documents are to be separate contracts with related data accessed by specifying a `securityId`.

## Backwards Compatibility

Equity tokens are not backwards compatible with [ERC-20](./eip-20.md) nor [ERC-3643](./eip-3643.md).

This standard introduces breaking changes to [ERC-3643](./eip-3643.md) by emphasizing each security issuance rather than fungible token balances. Methods like `freezePartialTokens` have been removed in favor of `freezeSecurity`. An additional `securityId` param is required for any method that modifies an account’s equity balance.

In addition to `mint` and `burn` [ERC-20](./eip-20.md) breaking changes, this standard introduces:

- the `shareClass` and `uri` parameters to the `issue` method
- a `securityId` parameter to `cancel`, `transfer`, and `transferFrom`, methods
- a `securityIds` parameter to corresponding batch methods
- a `shareClass` param to the `approve`, `increaseAllowance`, and `decreaseAllowance` methods
- corresponding event signatures.
