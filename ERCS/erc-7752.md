## Abstract

An ERC token standard representing private securities. This new interface standardizes equity management for issuers, investors, transfer agents, and financial intermediaries.

## Motivation

Equity tokens represent ownership shares of a company or asset, encapsulated in a digital token format on the blockchain. While traditional equity mainly refers to stock in a company, there's a growing need to represent ownership in alternative assets like fund interests, real estate, or Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) interests. Traditional methods of managing and transferring equity and alternative assets are often cumbersome, opaque, and involve significant administrative overhead. By bringing these assets on-chain, we can leverage blockchain technology to enhance transparency, efficiency, and accessibility in equity and alternative asset markets.

This ERC introduces a standard for representing ownership of equity and alternative assets on-chain, enabling companies and asset managers to issue, manage, and transfer tokens seamlessly. Key use cases for these tokens include:

- **Simplified Asset Management**: Automate cap table and asset register updates with each token transfer, reducing the need for manual reconciliation and minimizing errors.
- **Enhanced Liquidity**: Facilitate secondary markets for private equity and alternative assets, allowing shareholders and investors to trade their tokens under compliant conditions.
- **Fractional Ownership**: Enable investors to hold fractional interests in assets like funds and SPVs, lowering the barrier to entry and allowing for more diversified investment portfolios.
- **Diverse Asset Representation**: Tokenize a wide range of assets beyond traditional stock, including fund interests, SPV shares, real estate, and more.
- **Automated Compliance**: Enforce regulatory requirements and transfer restrictions programmatically through smart contracts.
- **Streamlined Corporate Actions**: Simplify processes like dividend distribution, profit sharing, voting, and investor communications by utilizing token holder data on the blockchain.

Implementing tokens representing equity and alternative assets on-chain provides a unified interface for issuers, investors, transfer agents, and financial intermediaries to interact with these assets. By adhering to the same design principles as the Open Cap Format (OCF)—an industry-approved data standard for cap tables and asset registers—this token standard ensures compatibility with existing management systems while leveraging the benefits of blockchain technology.

[ERC-7752](./eip-7752.md) bridges the gap between traditional equity and alternative asset markets and decentralized finance, fostering a more efficient, transparent, and inclusive financial ecosystem on Ethereum and beyond. By standardizing tokens for equity and alternative assets, we pave the way for innovative financial products and services that can streamline venture capital, private equity, and asset management operations.

## Specification

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119) and [RFC 8174](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8174).

A compliant smart contract represents ownership shares of equity and alternative assets, enabling the issuance, management, and transfer of these tokens while ensuring regulatory compliance and efficient asset management.

### Overview

  - `from`: Address sending the tokens.
  - `to`: Address receiving the tokens.
  - `tokenId`: ID of the token being transferred.
  - `amount`: Amount of tokens to transfer.
  - `data`: Additional data for compliance checks.

- **Requirements**:
  - MUST check if transfers are not paused.
  - MUST verify that neither the `from` nor the `to` addresses are frozen.
  - MUST enforce compliance rules via the Compliance contract.
  - MUST emit the `Transfer` and `TransferValue` events upon successful transfer.

#### Forced Transfers

The contract SHOULD implement a `forcedTransfer` function to allow transfers without holder consent:

    address _from,
    address _to,
    uint256 _id,
    uint256 _amount

function prefix() external view returns (string memory);
function onchainID() external view returns (address);
function version() external pure returns (string memory);
```

- **Requirements**:
  - MUST provide accurate metadata about the token contract.

### Compliance and Identity Management

The contract MUST interact with Compliance and Identity Registry contracts:

#### Identity Registry

```solidity
function identityRegistry() external view returns (IIdentityRegistry);
function setIdentityRegistry(address identityRegistryAddress) external;
```

- **Requirements**:

```

- **Requirements**:
  - MUST enforce regulatory compliance for token transfers.
  - `setCompliance` MUST only be callable by the contract owner.
  - MUST emit the `ComplianceAdded` event when updated.

### Recovery Mechanisms

The contract SHOULD provide mechanisms to recover tokens if a wallet is lost:

```solidity
function recoveryAddress(
    address _lostWallet,
    address _newWallet,
    address _investorOnchainID,
    uint256[] calldata _ids
) external returns (bool);
```

- **Requirements**:
  - MUST only be callable by an address with the `AgentRole`.
  - MUST verify the identity of the investor through the Identity Registry.
  - MUST emit the `RecoverySuccess` event upon successful recovery.

### Locking and Unlocking Tokens

The contract MUST allow token holders to lock and unlock their tokens:

```solidity
function lockTokens(uint256 tokenId, uint256 amount) external;
function unlockTokens(uint256 tokenId, uint256 amount) external;
```

- **Requirements**:
  - MUST prevent locked tokens from being transferred.
  - MUST emit `TokensLocked` and `TokensUnlocked` events accordingly.

### Events

The contract MUST emit events as specified in the interface to enable off-chain monitoring and compliance:

- `TokensLocked`
- `TokensUnlocked`
- `Approval`
- `ApprovalForAll`
- `Transfer`
- `TransferValue`
- `TokenInvalidated`
- `URI`
- `AgentAddedForToken`
- `AgentRemovedForToken`

- `ComplianceAdded`
- `Paused`
- `Unpaused`
- `Mint`
- `Burn`
- `AddressFrozen`
- `TokenFrozen`
- `TokenUnfrozen`
- `RecoverySuccess`

### Access Control

- The contract MUST implement role-based access control to restrict certain functions to authorized addresses (e.g., `AgentRole`).
- Ownership and agent roles SHOULD be managed securely to prevent unauthorized access.

### Compliance Requirements

- The contract MUST integrate with compliance modules to enforce KYC/AML regulations.
- Transfers MUST be checked against compliance rules before execution.

### Error Handling

- The contract SHOULD use standard OpenZeppelin error messages and revert reasons for consistency.
- MUST revert transactions that violate compliance rules, are paused, or involve frozen addresses/tokens.

### Backwards Compatibility

ERC-7752 is not backwards compatible with [ERC-20](./eip-20.md) or [ERC-3643](./eip-3643.md) due to:

- Introduction of unique `tokenId` for each issuance and transfer, differentiating tokens beyond simple fungible balances.
- Replacement of `mint` and `burn` methods with `issue` and `cancel` in earlier drafts, although `mint` and `burn` are used in this interface.
- Emphasis on individual securities rather than fungible token balances.

### Notes

- Vesting and governance mechanisms are considered separate concerns and SHOULD be addressed in companion ERCs.
- Contracts implementing ERC-7752 SHOULD ensure that they remain within the maximum contract size limits.
- Developers SHOULD consider gas efficiency when implementing batch operations and compliance checks.

## Rationale

The rationale behind ERC-7752 is to create a comprehensive and standardized framework for tokenizing equity and alternative assets on the Ethereum blockchain. Traditional financial instruments like stocks, fund interests, and SPV (Special Purpose Vehicle) shares are managed through legacy systems that are often inefficient, opaque, and fragmented. By standardizing these assets as tokens on the blockchain, we can address several key challenges in the current financial ecosystem.

### Bridging Traditional Finance and Blockchain Technology

One of the main goals of ERC-7752 is to bridge the gap between traditional finance (TradFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi). While blockchain technology has revolutionized many aspects of finance, there remains a significant divide when it comes to regulated securities and equity instruments. ERC-7752 aims to provide a compliant and secure method for representing these assets on-chain, ensuring that regulatory requirements are met while taking advantage of blockchain's benefits.

### Compliance and Regulatory Considerations

Compliance with KYC (Know Your Customer), AML (Anti-Money Laundering), and other regulatory requirements is paramount when dealing with equity and alternative assets. Unlike many existing token standards, ERC-7752 is designed with compliance at its core. By integrating with identity registries and modular compliance contracts, the standard ensures that only verified and authorized participants can hold and transfer tokens. This design caters to the needs of issuers and regulators, fostering trust and legitimacy in the tokenized assets.

### Flexibility for Diverse Asset Classes

ERC-7752 is deliberately designed to be flexible, accommodating a wide range of asset classes beyond traditional stock. This token standard supports the accounting for these assets in a way that is consistent with the way traditional financial instruments are accounted for.

### Enhanced Operational Efficiency

By automating processes such as cap table management, compliance checks, and corporate actions through smart contracts, ERC-7752 reduces administrative overhead and minimizes the risk of human error. This automation leads to cost savings and faster transaction times, benefiting both issuers and investors.

### Compatibility with Industry Standards

Adhering to the design principles of the Open Cap Format (OCF) ensures that these tokens are compatible with existing industry-approved data standards for cap tables and asset registers. This compatibility facilitates easier integration with legacy systems and promotes widespread adoption by aligning with familiar practices in the financial industry.

### Security and Recovery Mechanisms

Given the high value and regulatory importance of equity and alternative assets, ERC-7752 includes robust security features such as role-based access control, pausing mechanisms, and the ability to freeze addresses or tokens. Additionally, recovery functions are provided to handle situations like lost wallets, ensuring that asset control can be maintained or restored in compliance with legal requirements.

### Avoiding Fragmentation of Standards

While there are existing token standards like ERC-20 for fungible tokens and [ERC-721](./erc-721.md) for non-fungible tokens, they do not adequately address the specific needs of equity and alternative asset tokenization, particularly regarding compliance and regulatory requirements. By introducing ERC-7752, we provide a specialized standard that prevents fragmentation and inconsistency in how these assets are represented on the blockchain.

### Enabling Future Innovations

By establishing a solid foundation for tokenized equity and alternative assets, ERC-7752 paves the way for future innovations in the financial ecosystem. Standardization allows developers and financial institutions to build new services and platforms, such as decentralized exchanges for security tokens, automated compliance solutions, and innovative investment products that were not feasible under traditional systems.

### Conclusion

ERC-7752 is a comprehensive standard that addresses the unique challenges of tokenizing equity and alternative assets. By focusing on compliance, flexibility, and operational efficiency, it fosters greater trust and participation in blockchain-based financial instruments. The standard aims to catalyze the convergence of traditional finance and blockchain technology, ultimately contributing to a more inclusive and efficient global financial system.

## Backwards Compatibility

ERC-7752 introduces a comprehensive framework for tokenizing equity and alternative assets, which significantly extends beyond the capabilities of earlier token standards like ERC-20, ERC-721, and [ERC-1155](./eip-1155.md). While it incorporates some concepts from these standards, ERC-7752 is **not backwards compatible** with them due to several fundamental differences:

### Unique Token Identification and Granularity

- **Token IDs**: Unlike ERC-20 tokens, which are purely fungible and indistinct, ERC-7752 assigns a unique `tokenId` to each issuance and transfer. This allows for granular tracking of individual tokens, enabling features like fractional ownership, detailed compliance checks, and specific asset representation.
- **Granular Control**: ERC-7752's emphasis on individual securities and specific token units contrasts with the bulk balance approach of ERC-20, where all tokens are interchangeable and tracked by total balance per address.

### Compliance and Regulatory Features

- **Integrated Compliance**: ERC-7752 embeds compliance mechanisms at its core, integrating with Identity Registry and Compliance contracts. This ensures that all token holders meet KYC/AML requirements and that all transfers adhere to regulatory constraints.
- **Compliance Checks on Transfer**: Transfers in ERC-7752 involve verifying compliance rules before execution, which is absent in ERC-20 and ERC-721 standards.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: The standard introduces roles like `AgentRole`, granting specific permissions necessary for regulatory compliance. This model differs from the more permissive access in earlier standards.

### Modified Function Interfaces

- **Transfer Functions**: The `transferFrom` function in ERC-7752 includes additional parameters like `data` for compliance purposes and may return a new `tokenId`. This deviates from the simpler `transferFrom` in ERC-20 and ERC-721.
- **Minting and Burning**: While ERC-20 lacks standardized `mint` and `burn` functions, and ERC-721's `mint` and `burn` handle single tokens, ERC-7752's `mint` function can handle batch operations and includes compliance data, aligning more closely with the needs of equity issuance and cancellation.

### Event Definitions

- **Extended Events**: ERC-7752 defines additional events such as `Mint`, `Burn`, `TokensLocked`, `TokensUnlocked`, `AddressFrozen`, and `RecoverySuccess`. These events provide critical information for compliance and asset management that are not present in ERC-20 or ERC-721.
- **Event Structure**: The structure and triggers of events in ERC-7752 differ, meaning that applications listening for ERC-20 or ERC-721 events would not capture all necessary events from an ERC-7752 token.

### Batch Operations and Enhanced Functionality

- **Batch Transactions**: ERC-7752 supports batch operations for transfers, freezing, and forced transfers, which are not standardized in ERC-20 or ERC-721.
- **Recovery Mechanisms**: The inclusion of token recovery functions addresses scenarios like lost wallets, a feature not found in earlier standards.

### Token Metadata and Multidimensional Balances

- **Token Metadata**: ERC-7752's approach to token metadata includes `certificateURI` and handles multiple dimensions of information per token, differing from ERC-721's singular focus on NFTs and ERC-20's lack of individual token metadata.
- **Balances**: The standard allows querying balances both by address and by `tokenId`, providing a multidimensional view of ownership not available in ERC-20 or ERC-721.

### Freezing and Pausing Functionality

- **Address and Token Freezing**: ERC-7752 enables freezing specific addresses or tokens, preventing transfers as per compliance needs. ERC-20 and ERC-721 do not natively support this granularity of control.
- **Pausing Mechanism**: While [ERC-777](./erc-777.md) introduces pausing, ERC-7752's pausing is integrated with compliance, affecting how and why transfers can be halted.

### Non-Fungibility Within Fungibility

- **Hybrid Nature**: ERC-7752 tokens can represent fungible assets but also track individual units with unique `tokenId`s. This hybrid approach is distinct from ERC-20's fungibility and ERC-721's non-fungibility.
- **Fractional Ownership**: The standard supports fractional ownership of assets, which requires tracking fractions of tokens in ways that ERC-721 cannot accommodate.

### Contract Interactions and Dependencies

- **External Contracts**: ERC-7752 interacts with Identity Registry and Compliance contracts, introducing dependencies that are not present in ERC-20 or ERC-721 tokens.
- **Modular Compliance**: The standard's reliance on modular compliance contracts for enforcing rules adds complexity and inter-contract communication that differs from earlier standards.

### Conclusion

Due to these substantive differences, ERC-7752 is not backwards compatible with ERC-20, ERC-721, or ERC-1155. Applications, wallets, and exchanges designed exclusively for those standards would not be able to interact fully with ERC-7752 tokens without significant modifications. However, ERC-7752 aims to retain familiar patterns where possible to facilitate understanding and integration.

Developers and entities looking to adopt ERC-7752 should consider these differences carefully. While the standard introduces complexities required for regulatory compliance and advanced asset management, it also provides powerful new capabilities for representing and handling equity and alternative assets on-chain. Adoption may require updates to existing systems or the development of new tooling but offers the potential for improved efficiency, compliance, and functionality in the tokenization of traditional financial instruments.
