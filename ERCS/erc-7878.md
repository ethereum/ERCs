## Abstract

This EIP proposes a standard interface for contracts to allow tokens to be inherited after the owner's death. The interface allows token owners to set up a Will and designate executors to enable the transfer of tokens to inheritors after a specified waiting period.


## Motivation
Crypto Tokens in general and NFTs in particular are starting to be used to tokenise real-world assets. In order for them to be adopted by the main stream finance world, there needs to be a way to inherit these tokens after the owner has passed away. Currently, there is no standardised way for token holders to pass on their digital assets in the event of their death.  
This EIP aims to solve this problem by providing a standard interface for "bequeathable" tokens, allowing for a secure and transparent process of token inheritance.
In designing this interface we have tried to follow the real world process of Will creation and execution.


## Specification

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.

Every compliant contract MUST implement the `Bequeathable` interface:

```solidity
/// @title EIP-7878 Bequeathable tokens
/// @dev See https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7878

pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

/**
 * @notice Bequeathable interface
 */

interface Bequeathable {

   /**
    * @notice              Announce the owner's tokens are to be inherited
    * @dev                 Emitted by `announceObit`
    * @param   owner       The original owner of the tokens
    * @param   inheritor   The address of the wallet that will inherit the tokens once the moratoriumTTL time has passed
    */
   event ObituaryStarted(address indexed owner, address indexed inheritor);

   /** 
    * @notice               Announce the obituary (and moratorium) for the owner has been cancelled, as well as who cancelled it
    * @dev                  Emitted by `cancelObit`
    * @param   owner        The original owner of the tokens
    * @param   cancelledBy  The address that triggered this cancellation. This can be the owner or any of the inheritors
    */
   event ObituaryCancelled(address indexed owner, address indexed cancelledBy);

   /** 
    * @notice                 A token owner can set a Will and names one or more executors who are able to transfer their tokens after their death
    * @dev                    Although more than one executor address can be set, only one is required to start the process and then do the transfer
    * @dev                    Subsequent calls to this function should overwrite any existing Will
    * @param   executors      An array of executors eg legal council, spouse, child 1, child 2 etc..
    * @param   moratoriumTTL  The time that must pass (in seconds) from when the obituary is announced to when the inheritance transfer can take place
    * @dev                    The moratoriumTTL is a safety buffer time frame that allows for any intervention before the tokens get transferred
    */
   function setWill(address[] memory executors, uint256 moratoriumTTL) external;

   /**
    * @notice                  Get the details of a Will if set
    * @dev                     This is a way for the owner to confirm that they have correctly set their Will
    * @param    owner          The current owner of the tokens
    * @return   executors      A list of all the executors for this owners will
    * @return   moratoriumTTL  The length of time (in seconds) that must elapse after calling announceObit before the actual transfer can happen
    */
   function getWill(address owner) external view returns (address[] memory executors, uint256 moratoriumTTL);

   /**
    * @notice              Start the Obituary process, by announcing it and declaring who is the intended inheritor
    * @param   owner       The current owner of the tokens
    * @param   inheritor   The address of the owner to be
    */
   function announceObit(address owner, address inheritor) external;

   /**
    * @notice          Cancel the Obituary that has been previously announced. Can be called by any of the executors (or the owner if still around)
    * @param   owner   The original owner of the tokens
    */
   function cancelObit(address owner) external;

   /**
    * @notice                   Get the designated inheritor and how much time is left before the moratoriumTTL is satisfied
    * @param    owner           The current owner of the tokens
    * @return   inheritor       The named inheritor when the obituary was announced
    * @return   moratoriumTTL   The time left for the moratoriumTTL before the transfer can be done
    * @dev                      A minus figure for moratoriumTTL indicates that the wait time has elapsed and the tokens can be bequeathed
    */
   function getObit(address owner) external view returns (address inheritor, int256 moratoriumTTL);

   /**
    * @notice         Bequeath ie transfer the tokens to the previously declared inheritor
    * @param   owner  The original owner of the tokens
    * @dev            The transfer should happen to the inheritor address when `announceObit` was called
    */
   function bequeath(address owner) external;

}
```

### Functions

1. `setWill`: Allows a token owner to set up or update their Will.
2. `getWill`: Returns the current Will details for a given owner.
3. `announceObit`: Initiates the inheritance process by an executor.
4. `cancelObit`: Cancels an active obituary process.
5. `getObit`: Retrieves the current obituary status.
6. `bequeath`: Transfers tokens to the inheritor after the waiting period.

### Events

1. `ObituaryStarted`: Emitted when an obituary is announced.
2. `ObituaryCancelled`: Emitted when an obituary is cancelled.


## Rationale

The standard follows what currently happens in real life when preparing and executing a Will.
1. An owner writes a Will and in doing so names the executor(s) of their Will
2. Upon passing away, the executor will announce the Obituary
3. The Will is read and the inheritors are identified
4. The transfer of ownership is executed according to the wishes of the Will

However, real life is not always as straight forward as this. Conflicts happen all the time. To handle this situation and to keep the interface simple, we added the ability to cancel the Obituary by ANY of the executors. In this way, if there is any conflict, it can be challenged out in the courts and once the matter is settled, the Obituary process can start again.

Again to keep the interface clean, all the tokens get transferred to one address. It is then that person's responsibility to execute any further transfers.


## Backwards Compatibility

This EIP is compatible with existing token standards like [ERC-20](./eip-20.md), [ERC-721](./eip-721.md) and [ERC-1155](./eip-1155.md). It can be implemented alongside these standards without affecting their core functionality.


## Test Cases

Tests are included in [`Bequeath.test.js`](../assets/eip-7878/test/Bequeath.test.js).


## Reference Implementation

See [`Bequeathable.sol`](../assets/eip-7878/contracts/Bequeathable.sol)

## Security Considerations

Implementers should carefully consider access control mechanisms to ensure that only authorized parties can execute Will-related functions. 

The moratoriumTTL should be set to a reasonable duration to allow for potential disputes or corrections. We recommend at least 30 days, especially for tokens that are of high value.  It limits the potential damage in scenarios such as the obituray process being triggered by a bad actor who has taken over one of the executor wallets.
