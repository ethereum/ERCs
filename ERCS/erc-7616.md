## Abstract

This proposal outlines a standard for hybrid fungible tokens, integrating smart contract interfaces that are compatible with the [ERC-20](./eip-20.md) token standard. It synthesizes concepts from [ERC-721](./eip-721.md) with influences from the Semi-Fungible Token model of ERC-3525, introducing an innovative approach to manage both ERC-20 and ERC-721 within a single contract.

Drawing inspiration from ERC-3525(./eip-3525.md), ERC7616ValueTransferable standard incorporates a value attribute for tokens, analogous to the balance attribute in [ERC-20](./eip-20.md) tokens, to signify the token's quantitative aspect. However, it moves away from the notion of distinct 'slots' for each [ERC-721](./eip-721.md) token, opting instead to maintain [ERC-721](./eip-721.md) tokens consistently within a single slot.

## Motivation

The tokenization of digital assets in the cryptocurrency space represents a pivotal trend for effectively leveraging and managing these assets. Traditionally, this has been achieved through two distinct methods: fungible tokens, utilizing the ERC-20 standard, where each token unit is indistinguishable from another, and non-fungible tokens, primarily through the ERC-721 standard, which differentiates digital assets on an individual basis.

Despite their utility, each standard has notable limitations. ERC-20 lacks the ability to uniquely differentiate between assets, a feature that ERC-721 excels in. Conversely, ERC-721 tokens lack a quantitative dimension, significantly impacting their liquidity.

Previously, attempts to fractionalize ERC-721 tokens into ERC-20 tokens through auxiliary protocols have been suboptimal, mainly because after fractionalization, those ERC-721 tokens have been recycled into the common pool. Even though they are different from each other, this fractionalization process makes them indistinguishable. The rarer tokens, being more valuable than the common ones, lead to hesitance in fractionalizing rare NFTs due to the potential loss of control.

A promising resolution involves integrating ERC-20 and ERC-721 standards within a single contract framework.

While ERC-3525 made strides towards addressing these issues, it did not fully resolve the liquidity challenges, tending to resemble an NFT more than a fungible token, which limits its tradability on decentralized exchanges.

A more effective solution lies in the development of a hybrid fungible token that combines the quantitative advantages of ERC-20 with the qualitative uniqueness of ERC-721. The backward compatibility with ERC-20 offered by such hybrid tokens would leverage existing infrastructures, promoting quicker adoption.

Emerging use cases in the blockchain space illustrate the innovative coexistence of ERC-20 and ERC-721 standards within a unified contract framework, signaling a transformative shift in digital asset management.

One such example is Pandora ERC404, which uniquely allocates an ERC-721 token for each ERC-20 token held. This mechanism ensures that transferring an ERC-721 token inherently includes the associated ERC-20 token, embedding a layer of fractional ownership. However, unlike other NFT projects that boast a wide array of traits, ERC404 tokens possess limited variability, thereby enhancing their fungibility.

The burgeoning trend of inscriptions, as seen on platforms like insc.evm, further underscores the versatility of this integration. Each inscription represents an NFT that encapsulates a definite token quantity, enabling fluid token transfers among NFTs, a feature that expands the utility and interaction dynamics between tokens and NFTs.

Jelly.top introduces a novel concept by decoupling NFTs from tokens. This platform allows users to either attach value to NFTs or detach it, suggesting a model where tokens can establish a base value for NFTs while enabling collectors to preserve the uniqueness of their preferred NFT designs.

Despite the innovative strides, a fundamental compatibility issue persists between ERC-20 and ERC-721 standards. Currently, contracts are constrained to embody either standard but not both simultaneously. Shared events and functions, such as the Transfer event and balanceOf, complicate the discernibility between ERC-20 and ERC-721 interactions, posing challenges for application interoperability.

The development community has been actively exploring contracts that accommodate both ERC-20 and ERC-721 standards. As projects increasingly adopt bespoke solutions to navigate these complexities, the absence of a unified standard becomes more pronounced. The need for an official ERC to harmonize interactions with these hybrid models is becoming increasingly critical.

This proposed EIP seeks to elegantly bridge the divide between ERC-20 and ERC-721 standards, facilitating their coexistence within the same contract. This initiative aims to unlock a broad spectrum of DeFi and NFT functionalities, effectively dissolving the existing barriers between them. Crafted to introduce minimal modifications to the current standards, this proposal is geared towards ensuring that existing applications can seamlessly transition and adapt, heralding a new era of interoperability and flexibility in digital asset utilization.

### ERC-7616 ValueTransferable Token Receiver

If a smart contract wants to be informed when they receive values from other addresses, it should implement all of the functions in the `IERC7616Receiver` interface, in the implementation it can decide whether to accept or reject the transfer. See "Transfer Rules" for further detail.

```solidity
