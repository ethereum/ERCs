## Abstract

This proposal extends [ERC-7564](./eip-7564.md) NFT manager modules with [EIP-712](./eip-712.md) permit flows. It standardises message schemas, signature verification, and nonce handling so that smart wallets can delegate transfers and approvals of [ERC-721](./eip-721.md) and [ERC-1155](./eip-1155.md) assets without sending on-chain transactions themselves.

## Motivation

ERC-7564 equips smart wallets with an on-chain permissions framework for NFTs, but every interaction still requires the wallet contract to submit its own transaction. Users must maintain gas balances, and dApps that want claimable drops or delegated marketplace access resort to bespoke signature formats that do not interoperate.

Introducing a standard permit flow allows the wallet owner to sign once off-chain while a dApp or relayer later submits the operation on-chain and pays gas for the user. This enables:

- gasless NFT interactions (listings, transfers, staking) without requiring the owner to hold native gas tokens;
- claimable "red packet" or reward drops where a signed `nftTransferWithSig` lets community members redeem later;
- universal coverage for any ERC-721 or ERC-1155 asset managed by the wallet's NFT module;
- interoperable tooling because wallets, marketplaces, and relayers share one EIP-712 schema and nonce model.

Taken together, the ERC-7564 permit extension allows NFT dApps to provide gasless, permissioned operations through a unified standard instead of fragmented, project-specific signatures.

## Specification

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.

### Interfaces

Implementations MUST expose the following interface in addition to the baseline ERC-7564 API:

```solidity
interface IERC8067 {
    function nftTransferNonce(address asset, address operator) external view returns (uint256);

    function nftTransferWithSig(
        address asset,
        address to,
        uint256 tokenId,
        uint256 deadline,
        bytes calldata signature
    ) external returns (bool success);

    function nftApproveNonce(address asset, uint256 tokenId, address operator) external view returns (uint256);

    function nftApproveWithSig(
        address asset,
        address operator,
        uint256 tokenId,
        uint256 deadline,
        bytes calldata signature
    ) external returns (bool success);

    function nftApprovalForOneAllNonce(address asset, address operator) external view returns (uint256);

    function nftSetApprovalForOneAllWithSig(
        address asset,
        address operator,
        bool approved,
        uint256 deadline,
        bytes calldata signature
    ) external returns (bool success);

    function nftApprovalForAllAllNonce(address operator) external view returns (uint256);

    function nftSetApprovalForAllAllWithSig(
        address operator,
        bool approved,
        uint256 deadline,
        bytes calldata signature
    ) external returns (bool success);
}
```

All functions MUST mirror the behaviour of their on-chain ERC-7564 counterparts once the signature is accepted. Implementations MUST support wallets that verify signatures through [ERC-1271](./eip-1271.md). If a wallet wraps signatures, the module MUST unwrap them before verification.




### Typed-Data

Each function MUST hash one of the following primary types before invoking the wallet's signature validation logic. The `wallet` field identifies the smart wallet executing the module. In all payloads `nonce` is the value returned by the corresponding nonce view function. The `operator` field identifies the authorised operator and acts as the sharding key for replay protection; any relayer MAY submit the signed payload.

| Function | Primary Type | Fields |
|----------|--------------|--------|
| `nftTransferWithSig` | `NFTTransferWithSig` | `wallet`,  `asset`, `to`, `tokenId`, `nonce`, `deadline` |
| `nftApproveWithSig` | `NFTApproveWithSig` | `wallet`, `asset`, `operator`, `tokenId`, `nonce`, `deadline` |
| `nftSetApprovalForOneAllWithSig` | `NFTApprovalForOneAllWithSig` | `wallet`,  `asset`, `operator`, `approved`, `nonce`, `deadline` |
| `nftSetApprovalForAllAllWithSig` | `NFTApprovalForAllAllWithSig` | `wallet`,  `operator`, `approved`, `nonce`, `deadline` |

Every permit MUST use the following domain values:

- `name = "NFTManager Permit"`
- `version = "1"`
- `chainId` equal to the executing chain
- `verifyingContract = address(this)`

### Nonce Semantics

- `nftTransferNonce` MUST derive a unique nonce per `(asset, operator)` tuple.
- `nftApproveNonce` MUST derive a unique nonce per `(asset, tokenId, operator)` tuple.
- `nftApprovalForOneAllNonce` MUST derive a unique nonce per `(asset, operator)` tuple.
- `nftApprovalForAllAllNonce` MUST derive a unique nonce per `(operator)` tuple.

Each `WithSig` function MUST increment the relevant nonce immediately before state changes and MUST revert on signature reuse.

### Execution Requirements

Implementations MUST follow these rules when processing a permit:

1. Treat `deadline` equal to `0` as non-expiring; otherwise enforce `block.timestamp <= deadline`.
2. Increment the relevant nonce before invoking the underlying ERC-7564 function.
3. Emit the same events as the underlying ERC-7564 function.
4. Revert if validation fails at any stage (invalid signature, expired deadline, or mismatched asset parameters).

Wallets MAY expose additional permit helpers, but they MUST NOT change the semantics defined above.

## Rationale

ERC-7564 already defines transfer and approval functions for NFT managers inside smart wallets. The permit extension mirrors those entry points so that wallets can capture the same behaviour with off-chain signatures:

- The shared domain name enables reusable tooling while remaining specific to NFT managers.
- Reusing existing ERC-7564 methods after verification keeps events and downstream integrations unchanged.

## Backwards Compatibility

Existing ERC-7564 modules remain valid. Clients SHOULD detect permit support via [ERC-165](./eip-165.md) or by probing for the new function selectors. Wallets that do not implement this extension can ignore the additional functions without changing behaviour.

## Test Cases

A public test suite will accompany the reference implementation. Implementers are encouraged to cover:

- successful transfers, approvals, and operator grants submitted by authorised relayers,
- rejection of expired permits, or mismatched assets,
- nonce incrementing when downstream token logic reverts,
- replay protection across all nonce domains.

## Reference Implementation

A reference implementation will be published after the draft is reviewed. It validates the typed-data digest, increments the scoped nonce before external calls, and then invokes the underlying ERC-7564 function so that events and storage remain consistent.


## Security Considerations

- Implementations MUST increment the nonce before calling external token contracts so that reverts cannot reopen a signature.
- Wallets SHOULD bound permit validity windows and monitor outstanding `approved = true` operator signatures to limit abuse.
