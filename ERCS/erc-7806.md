## Abstract

This proposal defines a standard interface for intent-centric smart accounts. It enables externally owned accounts (EOAs) to delegate contract code to a smart account implementation, allowing them to sign intents. These intents can then be executed by solvers (or relayers) on behalf of the account owner, streamlining interactions and expanding the capabilities of EOAs.

## Motivation

Account Abstraction (AA) is a highly discussed topic in the blockchain industry, as it enhances the programmability of accounts, enabling features such as:

* **Batch Execution**
* **Gas Sponsorship**
* **Access Control**

The introduction of [ERC-4337](./eip-4337.md) established a permissionless standard for AA, unlocking a wide range of powerful features. However, ERC-4337 has several limitations:

* **Complexity**: The standard requires multiple interdependent components, including the Account, EntryPoint, Paymaster, Bundler, and additional plugins ([ERC-6900](./eip-6900.md), [ERC-7579](./eip-7579.md). Running a bundler demands significant engineering expertise and introduces operational overhead.
* **Compatibility**: Component dependencies make upgrades cumbersome, often requiring multiple smart contracts to be updated simultaneously. This creates fragmentation within the ecosystem.
  one version update, also divides the ecosystem.
* **Cost**: Processing `UserOperation` transactions consumes a high amount of gas.
* **Trust Assumption**: Despite being designed as a permissionless standard, ERC-4337 still relies on centralized entities. Paymasters, for instance, are typically centralized, as they must either trust account owners to reimburse gas costs or manage external funding sources. Similarly, bundlers operate within a miner extractable value (MEV) environment, requiring users to trust them for transaction inclusion.

[ERC-7521](./eip-7521.md) introduced a smart contract account (SCA) solution with an intent-centric design. It allows solvers to fulfill account owners' intents while maintaining flexibility for custom execution logic and ensuring forward compatibility.

With the introduction of `SET_CODE_TX_TYPE=0x04`, EOAs can now set contract code dynamically, granting them programmability similar to SCAs. This presents an opportunity to develop a new standard that extends AA capabilities to EOAs while addressing the aforementioned challenges.

By simplifying execution, improving efficiency, and enhancing user experience, this proposal aims to accelerate the adoption of intent-centric account abstraction smart contracts.

### Solvers, Relayers, Paymasters, and Bundlersâ€”All in One

In an intent-centric system, solvers play a crucial role in fulfilling user intents and are rewarded accordingly. This proposal introduces an open execution model, where any solver can participate, fostering a competitive environment that benefits users.

With integrated gas abstraction, solvers can cover gas fees using native tokens while receiving other tokens from the EOA account as compensation. Additionally, solvers can further optimize costs by bundling multiple intent executions into a single blockchain transaction.

Each solver is free to develop its own strategies for maximizing profitability. This proposal does not impose restrictions on how solvers execute intents, ensuring flexibility and adaptability in diverse execution scenarios.

## Specification

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT
RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.

### `UserIntent` schema

Each intent is a packed data structure containing sufficient information about the operations the account owner wants to execute. The core structure of a `UserIntent` object is as follows:

| Field          | Type      | Description                                                                                                     |
|----------------|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `sender`       | `address` | The address of the account initiating the intent.                                                               |
| `standard`     | `address` | The `IStandard` implementation responsible for validating and parsing the `UserIntent`                          |
| `header`       | `bytes`   | Metadata associated with the `UserIntent`, interpreted by `standard`. Stored as bytes for flexibility.          |
| `instructions` | `bytes[]` | The execution details of the `UserIntent`, interpreted by `standard`. Stored as `bytes[]` to allow flexibility. |
| `signatures`   | `bytes[]` | Validatable signatures required for execution, interpreted by `standard`.                                       |

#### Fields Explanations

* `header`: The `bytes header` can carry information about how to validate the intent or how to prevent
  double-spending. For example, `header` can contain an `uint256 nonce` to check if the `nonce` is used already.
* `instructions`: These `bytes instructions` can just be concatenated `(address,value,calldata)` or can be
  standardized values, for example `(erc20TokenAddress,1000)` means the `instructions` can use up to 1000 of the
  specified [ERC-20](./eip-20.md) token. It is NOT REQUIRED that all `instructions` MUST be provided by the EOA owner to allow dynamically carry out other operations during intent executions, but the `IStandard` design needs to carefully handle this case.
* `signatures`: The `bytes signatures` field can support different signing methods. It is NOT REQUIRED that
  all `signatures` MUST be provided by the EOA owner, some of them MAY be provided by solver, relayer or anyone else.

### Pack `UserIntent` as Bytes

The `UserIntent` object is packed and encoded into `bytes calldata userIntent`. There is no strict schema requirement for the data structure. Each `IAccount` and `IStandard` implementation can define its own encoding and decoding methods for handling the `bytes` data.

Here is an example of packed-encoded format:

| Section                         | Value Type | Description                                              |
|---------------------------------|------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| userIntent[0:20]                | `address`  | `sender`                                                 |
| userIntent[20:40]               | `address`  | `standard`                                               |
| userIntent[40:42]               | `uint16`   | Length of `header`                                       |
| userIntent[42:44]               | `uint16`   | Length of `instructions`                                 |
| userIntent[44:46]               | `uint16`   | Length of `signatures`                                   |
| Next `headerLength` bytes       | `bytes`    | The actual `header` data                                 |
| Next `instructionsLength` bytes | `bytes`    | The actual `instructions` data                           |
| Next `signatureLength` bytes    | `bytes`    | The actual `signatures` data                             |
| Remaining bytes                 | `bytes`    | Extra data, such as nested intents for further execution |

### `IStandard` Interface

Each standard defines how to parse and validate a `UserIntent`. Implementations of standard must conform to the `IStandard` interface:

```solidity
interface IStandard {
    /**
     * Validate user's intent
     *
     * @dev returning validation result, the type uses bytes4 for extensibility purpose
     * @return result values representing validation outcomes
     */
    function validateUserIntent(bytes calldata intent) external view returns (bytes4 result);

    /**
     * Unpack user's intent, it is RECOMMENDED to validate intent while unpacking to save gas
     *
     * @dev returning unpacked result, the type uses bytes for extensibility purpose
     * @return result unpacked result status
     * @return operations unpacked operations that can be executed by the IAccount, NOT REQUIRED to match UserIntent.instructions
     */
    function unpackOperations(bytes calldata intent) external view returns (bytes4 result, bytes[] memory operations);
}
```

The `IStandard` interface is responsible for defining and enforcing the validation logic for `UserIntent` objects.

It operates similarly to the `EntryPoint` in ERC-4337 and ERC-7521.

The extensibility of `bytes4` return types allows future upgrades without modifying the function signatures.

### `IAccount` Interface

On the account side, `IAccount` provides the interface for executing `bytes calldata intent`:

```solidity
interface IAccount {
    /**
     * Execute user's intent
     * 
     * @dev returning execution result, the type uses bytes for extensibility purpose
     * @return result values representing execution outcomes
     */
    function executeUserIntent(bytes calldata intent) external returns (bytes memory);
}
```

Using `SET_CODE_TX_TYPE=0x04`, EOAs can delegate contract code to an `IAccount` implementation, enabling them to function as smart accounts. A single account implementation can be shared across multiple EOAs, meaning:
- It only needs to be deployed and audited once.
- Each EOA owner is responsible for delegating their account to a secure `IAccount` implementation.

It is RECOMMENDED that each account leverages `IStandard` to validate and unpack operations, check **Reference
Implementation** for examples. Account smart contract can be stateless to avoid sharing storage space with other delegated contracts.

## Rationale

### Usage of Bytes

Defining `UserIntent` object as a struct would improve readability and make it easier to work with in Solidity. For example:

```solidity
struct UserIntent {
    address sender;
    address standard;
    bytes header;
    bytes[] instructions;
    bytes[] signatures;
}
```

However, this approach has several drawbacks:

- Mandating all `IAccount` and `IStandard` implementations to follow this specific struct format reduces flexibility.
- The use of `bytes[]` introduces additional gas costs due to Solidity's dynamic array encoding.

Since all objects within the UserIntent structure are optional and their usage depends on `IStandard` and `IAccount` implementations, the bytes format ensures maximum flexibility while preserving compatibility.

### Execution in EOA Contract Code

With `SET_CODE_TX_TYPE=0x04`, EOAs gain the ability to execute contract code. Executing transactions directly from an EOA provides several key benefits:

- **Preserves EOA Control**: Execution remains fully controlled by the account owner. If needed, the EOA owner can easily disable all smart contract functionalities by un-delegating the contract code.
- **Consistent `msg.sender` Behavior**: Since the execution originates from an EOA, `msg.sender` always resolves to the EOA address, simplifying authentication and permission checks.
- **Stateless Execution**: The execution logic can be designed to be stateless, allowing the `IAccount` implementation to avoid storing persistent data, reducing storage costs.

If an EOA does not require smart contract execution, or if executing an intent is too expensive, the owner can still use the account as a regular EOA without any modifications.

### Validation in the Standard Contract

Validation logic often relies on contract state. For example, a weighted multi-owner signature scheme needs to track the weight assigned to each signer. Keeping intent validation entirely within `IStandard` offers multiple advantages:

- **Simplified Implementation**: By mirroring the `EntryPoint` concept from ERC-4337 but in a simpler form, `IStandard` focuses solely on validation.
- **Easier Auditing and Maintenance**: Since `IStandard` is responsible only for validation, it becomes easier for contract engineers to implement, audit, and maintain.
- **Modular Validation**: The `IStandard` interface is inherently modular, allowing for more complex validation mechanisms. For instance, a "compound" standard could decompose an intent into smaller components, validate each separately, and then combine the results.

### Gas Abstraction

This design enables gasless transactions by allowing any address to initiate a transaction on behalf of the intent's sender.

- The sender can specify how and what to pay in the intentâ€™s `header` or `instructions`.
- Payments can be made in any token from the senderâ€™s account.
- The transaction cost can be covered by transferring tokens from the senderâ€™s account to `tx.origin` (the address submitting the transaction).

### No re-entry protection enforced

This proposal does not enforce built-in re-entry protection mechanisms such as nonces. The rationale behind this decision is that certain intents are inherently designed to be executed multiple times.

Instead of a global re-entry protection mechanism, each standard should define its own protection rules based on its intended use case. Implementers are encouraged to:

## Backwards Compatibility

This `IAccount` standard shares the same backwards compatibility considerations as the introduction of EOA contract code execution (`SET_CODE_TX_TYPE=0x04`).

## Reference Implementation

### Helper Library

This `PackedIntent` is a library to decode `(address sender, address standard, uint16 headerLength, uint16 instructionsLength, uint16 signaturesLength)` from a packed encoded intent. The following `IAccount` and `IStandrd` implementations both follow `PackedIntent` schema.

```solidity
/// @title PackedIntent

    function getSenderAndStandard(bytes calldata intent) external pure returns (address, address) {
        require(intent.length >= 40, "Intent too short");
        return (address(bytes20(intent[: 20])), address(bytes20(intent[20 : 40])));
    }

    /// @notice getLengths is a function that gets the lengths from the intent
    /// @param intent The intent to get the lengths from
    /// @return headerLength The length of the header

    function getLengths(bytes calldata intent) external pure returns (uint256, uint256, uint256) {
        require(intent.length >= 46, "Missing length section");
        return (
        uint256(uint16(bytes2(intent[40 : 42]))),
        uint256(uint16(bytes2(intent[42 : 44]))),
        uint256(uint16(bytes2(intent[44 : 46])))
        );
    }

    /// @notice getSignatureLength is a function that gets the signature length from the intent
    /// @param intent The intent to get the signature length from

    function getSignatureLength(bytes calldata intent) external pure returns (uint256) {
        require(intent.length >= 46, "Missing length section");
        return uint256(uint16(bytes2(intent[44 : 46])));
    }

    /// @notice getIntentLength is a function that gets the intent length from the intent

        uint256 headerLength = uint256(uint16(bytes2(intent[40 : 42])));
        uint256 instructionLength = uint256(uint16(bytes2(intent[42 : 44])));
        uint256 signatureLength = uint256(uint16(bytes2(intent[44 : 46])));
        return headerLength + instructionLength + signatureLength + 46;
    }

            let a := shr(240, value) // Extract first 2 bytes
            let b := and(shr(224, value), 0xFFFF) // Extract next 2 bytes

            result := add(add(add(a, b), c), 46)
        }
    }
}

```

### Relayed Execution Standard

This `RelayedExecutionStandard` allows relayer to execute the operations on chain and take [ERC-20](./eip-20.md) token from the intent sender, thus achieve a gas-less experience for the sender.

```solidity
import {MessageHashUtils}
import {ECDSA}
import {IERC20}
import {IStandard}
import {IAccount}
import {PackedIntent}

/// @title ERC7806Constants
/// @notice This is a library that defines the constants for the ERC7806 standard
library ERC7806Constants {
/// @notice VALIDATION_DENIED is the magic value of denied intent
bytes4 public constant VALIDATION_DENIED = 0x00000000;

/// @notice VALIDATION_APPROVED is the magic value of validated intent
bytes4 public constant VALIDATION_APPROVED = 0x00000001;
}

abstract contract HashGatedStandard is IStandard {
    event HashUsed(address sender, uint256 hash);

    mapping(bytes32 => bool) internal _hashes;

    function checkHash(address sender, uint256 hash) external view returns (bool) {
        bytes32 compositeKey = keccak256(abi.encode(sender, hash));
        return _hashes[compositeKey];
    }

    function markHash(uint256 hash) external {
        bytes32 compositeKey = keccak256(abi.encode(msg.sender, hash));
        _hashes[compositeKey] = true;

        emit HashUsed(msg.sender, hash);
    }
}

/*
RelayedExecutionStandard

This standard allows sender to define a list of execution instructions and asks the relayer to execute
on chain on behalf of the sender. It is hash and time gated means the intent can only be executed before
a timestamp and can only be executed once.

The first 20 bytes of the `intent` is sender address.
The next 20 bytes of the `intent` is the standard address, which should be equal to address of this standard.
The following is the length section, containing 3 uint16 defining header length, instructions length and signature length.

The header is either 8 bytes long or 28 bytes long.
The 8-byte part is the timestamp in epoch seconds.
The optional 20-byte defines the assigned relayer address if the sender only wants a specific relayer to execute.

The instructions contains 2 main part.
The first 36 bytes is a packed encoded (address, uint128) pair representing the 'payment' that the sender will pay to the
relayer. It should be an ERC20 token.
The following 1-byte is an uint8 defining the number of instructions to execute.
The instructions are concatenated together, the first 2 bytes (uint16) defines the length of each instruction, the following
is the instruction body. Instructions should be abi.encode(address, uint256, bytes) which can directly be executed by
the sender account.

The signature field is always 65 bytes long. It contains the signed bytes.concat(header, instructions).

As shown above, the implementation of `IAccount` is stateless and simple, so that it can be compatible with different `IStandard`.
While the `IStandard` implementation is complex because it needs to define its own schema. But both contracts will be public
and audited, to ensure the security of intent execution.

## Security Considerations

The security of this standard primarily depends on the implementation of both `IStandard` and `IAccount`. Each component must ensure that user intents are validated and executed safely. Additionally, solvers are responsible for securing their own execution environments to prevent unintended exploits.

### Auditability of both Validation and Execution

To ensure security and maintain ecosystem integrity, it is critical that both the standard (`IStandard`) and account (`IAccount`) implementations are:

- **Publicly auditable**: Open access to contract code allows security researchers to identify potential vulnerabilities.
- **Well-reviewed and shared**: Public discussions and peer reviews help strengthen security assumptions.
- **Secure against compatibility risks**: Ensuring compatibility between different standard and account implementations can prevent unintended interactions that may lead to exploits.

### Delegated Contract Storage Risks

If an `IAccount` implementation maintains state (instead of being stateless), it could:
- Interfere with other delegated contracts sharing the same storage.
- Be manipulated by unauthorized users if storage is not properly protected.

Strongly RECOMMEND stateless execution to prevent storage conflicts.
