## Abstract

The following standard provides a generic method for checking whether a given account has permissions on a contract

This can be used for permissions such as token blacklists, minimum token holdings, vaults with allowlists built in, and any other permissions relevant to smart contract execution.

## Motivation

While there has been standards focused on defining permissions for ERC20 token transfers (e.g. ERC-1404), there is no standard that enables any permission for any arbitrary contract to be retrieved.

## Specification

### Methods

#### `isPermissioned(address)`

Returns `true` if the `user` is permissioned to interact with the contract.

```yaml
- name: isPermissioned
  type: function
  stateMutability: view

  inputs:
    - name: user
      type: address

  outputs:
    - name: status
      type: bool
```

### [ERC-165](./eip-165.md) support

Smart contracts implementing this Vault standard MUST implement the [ERC-165](./eip-165.md) `supportsInterface` function.

Contracts MUST return the constant value `true` if `0x78d77ecb` is passed through the `interfaceID` argument.

## Rationale

TODO

## Security Considerations

Users should not assume having a permission ensures their calls will be guaranteed to succeed.
