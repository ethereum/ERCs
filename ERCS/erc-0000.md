## Abstract

ERC-8008 defines the wallet-facing usage of the Ethereum Interoperability Layer (EIL). It specifies how wallets and SDKs handle cross-chain actions.

## Motivation
Today, wallets expose fragmented UX when dealing with cross-chain interactions. Users must choose chains, manage bridging, and handle gas on multiple networks. ERC-8008 introduces a standard way for wallets and SDKs to submit cross-chain operations using EIL so that users can sign once and execute across multiple chains. 

## Specification

### A new EIP-5792 capability `cross_chain`

For each call element of the wallet_sendCalls payload, the caller SHOULD provide the following capability object:
```
{
chainId: number,
}
```
### SDK behaviour
The SDK provides an API for user-facing applications to interact with multiple EVM-compatible chains without exposing the end-users to the complexity of cross-chain communication.

1. Collects the list of actions performed by the user in the desired order of execution
2. Internally, creates a list of optional actions that can be performed by the system to clean up
3. Perform a wallet_sendCalls with a cross_chain capability 
    a. This feature builds on top of EIP-5792 wallet_sendCalls 
    b. The `cross_chain` capability adds support for the Ethereum Interoperability Layer, acting as a trusted cross-chain transport layer
4. Handle the results of the execution

### Wallet behaviour
The Wallet supporting the cross_chain capability MUST:
1. Verify the correctness of the submitted wallet_sendCalls with cross_chain capability 
2. Convert the inputs into an array of valid ERC-4337 UserOperations
3. Present the contents of all actions combined to the user for signing
4. Upon signing, orchestrate the execution of the signed array of UserOperations

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.

## Rationale

We scoped ERC-8008 to wallet/SDK usage only. Full protocol mechanism design will be described in separate ERCs to avoid overwhelming wallet developers with unnecessary detail.

## Backwards Compatibility

No backward compatibility issues found.
