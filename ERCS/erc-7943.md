## Abstract

This EIP proposes the Universal RWA (uRWA) standard, an interface for tokenized Real World Assets (RWAs) such as securities, real estate, commodities, or other physical/financial assets on the blockchain. 

Real World Assets often require regulatory compliance features not found in standard tokens, including the ability to freeze assets, perform enforcement transfers for legal compliance, and restrict transfers to authorized users. The uRWA standard extends common token standards like [ERC-20](./eip-20.md), [ERC-721](./eip-721.md) or [ERC-1155](./eip-1155.md) by introducing essential compliance functions while remaining minimal and not opinionated about specific implementation details.

This enables DeFi protocols and applications to interact with tokenized real-world assets in a standardized way, knowing they can check transfer permissions, whether users are allowed to interact, handle frozen assets appropriately, and integrate with compliant RWA tokens regardless of the underlying asset type or internal compliance logic. It also adopts [ERC-165](./eip-165.md) for introspection.

## Motivation

Real World Assets (RWAs) represent a significant opportunity to bridge traditional finance and decentralized finance (DeFi). By tokenizing assets like real estate, corporate bonds, commodities, art, or securities, we can unlock benefits such as fractional ownership, programmable compliance, enhanced liquidity through secondary markets for traditionally illiquid assets and integration with decentralized protocols.

However, tokenizing real world assets introduces regulatory requirements often absent in purely digital assets, such as allowlists for users, transfer restrictions, asset freezing or law enforcement rules. Existing token standards like [ERC-20](./eip-20.md), [ERC-721](./eip-721.md) and [ERC-1155](./eip-1155.md) lack the inherent structure to address these compliance needs directly within the standard itself.

Attempts at defining universal RWA standards historically imposed unnecessary complexity and gas overhead for simpler use cases that do not require the full spectrum of features like granular role-based access control, mandatory on-chain whitelisting, specific on-chain identity solutions, or metadata handling solutions mandated by the standard.

Additionally, the broad spectrum of RWA classes inherently suggests the need to move away from a one-size-fits-all solution. With the purpose in mind of defining an EIP for it, a minimalistic approach, unopinionated features list and maximally compatible design should be kept in mind.

The uRWA standard seeks a more refined balance by defining an essential interface, establishing a common ground for interaction regarding compliance and control, without dictating the underlying implementation mechanisms. This allows core token implementations to remain lean while providing standard functions for RWA-specific interactions.

The final goal is to build composable DeFi around RWAs, providing the same interface when dealing with compliance and regulation.

## Specification

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.

The following defines the standard interface for an [ERC-7943](./eip-7943.md) token contract, which MUST extend from a base token interface such as [ERC-20](./eip-20.md), [ERC-721](./eip-721.md) or [ERC-1155](./eip-1155.md):

### `isUserAllowed`, `isTransferAllowed` and `getFrozen`

These provide views into the implementing contract's compliance, transfer policy logic and freezing status. These functions:

- MUST NOT revert. 
- MUST NOT change the storage of the contract. 
- MAY depend on context (e.g., current timestamp, block number).
- The `isTransferAllowed` MUST validate that the `amount` being transferred doesn't exceed the unfrozen amount (which is the difference between the current balance and the frozen balance). Additionally it MUST perform an `isUserAllowed` check on the `from` and `to` parameters.

### `forceTransfer`

This function provides a standard mechanism for forcing a transfer from a `from` to a `to` address. The function:

- MUST directly manipulate balances or ownership to transfer the asset from `from` to `to` either by transferring or burning from `from` and minting to `to`.
- MUST be restricted in access.
- MUST perform necessary validation checks (e.g., sufficient balance/ownership of a specific token).
- MUST emit both the standard transfer event (from the base standard) and the `ForcedTransfer` event.
- It CAN bypass the freezing validations and update the freezing status accordingly. Only if this happens, it MUST unfreeze the assets first and emit a `Frozen` event before the underlying base token transfer event reflecting the change. Having the unfrozen amount changed before the actual transfer is critical for tokens that might be susceptible to reentrancy attacks doing external checks on recipients as it is the case for [ERC-721](./eip-721.md) and [ERC-1155](./eip-1155.md) tokens. 
- MUST bypass checks enforced by `isTransferAllowed`.
- MUST perform an `isUserAllowed` check on the `to` parameter.

### `setFrozen`

It provides a way to freeze or unfreeze assets held by a specific user. This is useful for temporary lock mechanisms. This function:

- MUST emit the `Frozen` event.
- MUST be restricted in access.
- SHOULD NOT allow freezing more assets than those held by the user.

### Additional Specifications

The contract MUST implement the [ERC-165](./eip-165.md) `supportsInterface` function and MUST return true for the `bytes4` value `0xf35fc3be` being it the `interfaceId` of the [ERC-7943](./eip-7943.md).

Given the agnostic nature of the standard on the specific base token standard being used, the implementation SHOULD use `tokenId = 0` for [ERC-20](./eip-20.md) based implementations, and `amount = 1` for [ERC-721](./eip-721.md) based implementations on `ForcedTransfer` and `Frozen` events, `ERC7943NotAllowedTransfer` and `ERC7943InsufficientUnfrozenBalance` errors, and `forceTransfer`, `setFrozen`, `getFrozen` and `isTransferAllowed` functions. Integrators MAY decide to not enforce this, however the standard discourages it. This is considered a minor tradeoff for having a unique standard interface for different token standards without overlapping syntaxes.

Implementations of this interface MUST implement the necessary functions of their chosen base standard (e.g., [ERC-20](./eip-20.md), [ERC-721](./eip-721.md) and [ERC-1155](./eip-1155.md) functionalities) and MUST also restrict access to sensitive functions like `forceTransfer` and `setFrozen` using an appropriate access control mechanism (e.g., `onlyOwner`, Role-Based Access Control). The specific mechanism is NOT mandated by this interface standard.

Implementations MUST ensure their transfer methods exhibit the following behavior:

- **Public transfers** (`transfer`, `transferFrom`, `safeTransferFrom`, etc.) MUST NOT succeed in cases in which `isTransferAllowed` or  `isUserAllowed` would return `false` for either one or both `from` and `to` addresses.
- **Minting** MUST NOT succeed to accounts where `isUserAllowed` would return `false`.
- **Burning** SHOULD NOT be restricted by `isTransferAllowed` or `isUserAllowed` checks on the token holder. It MAY be restricted to prevent burning more assets than the unfrozen amount (e.g., in public burning functions). It MAY burn more assets than the unfrozen amount (e.g., in permissioned burning functions), in which case the contract MUST update the frozen status accordingly and emit a `Frozen` event before the underlying base token transfer event.

The `ERC7943NotAllowedTransfer` and `ERC7943NotAllowedUser` errors CAN be used as a general revert mechanism whenever internal calls to `isUserAllowed` or `isTransferAllowed` return false. Those MAY NOT be used or MAY be replaced by more specific errors depending on the custom checks performed inside those calls.

In general, the standard prioritizes error specificity, meaning that broad errors such as `ERC7943NotAllowedTransfer` SHOULD be thrown if more specific ones such as `ERC7943InsufficientUnfrozenBalance` do not apply. The same is true for `ERC7943InsufficientUnfrozenBalance` that SHOULD be triggered when a transfer is attempted from `user` with an `amount` of `tokenId` less than or equal to its balance, but greater than its unfrozen balance. But if the amount is greater than the whole balance, unrelated from the frozen amount, more specific errors from the base standard SHOULD be used instead.

## Rationale

*   **Minimalism:** Defines only the essential functions (`forceTransfer`, `setFrozen`, `isUserAllowed`, `isTransferAllowed`, `getFrozen`) and associated events/errors needed for common RWA compliance and control patterns, avoiding mandated complexity or opinionated features. The reason to introduce specific errors (`ERC7943NotAllowedUser`, `ERC7943NotAllowedTransfer` and `ERC7943InsufficientUnfrozenBalance`) is to provide completeness with the introduced functionalities (`isUserAllowed`, `isTransferAllowed` and `getFrozen`). As dictated in the specifications, error specificity is prioritized, leaving space for implementations to accommodate more explicit errors. Regarding the events `Frozen` and `ForcedTransfer`, the reason for their existence is to signal _uncommon_ transfers (like in `forceTransfer`) but also to help off-chain indexers to correctly keep track and account for asset seizures and freezing. As mentioned in the specifications, special attention should be paid to the order in which these events are emitted in relation to the base token contract events.
*   **Flexible compliance:** Provides standard view functions (`isUserAllowed`, `isTransferAllowed`, `getFrozen`) for compliance checks without dictating *how* those checks are implemented internally by the token contract. This allows diverse compliance strategies.
*   **Compatibility:** Designed as an interface layer compatible with existing base standards like [ERC-20](./eip-20.md), [ERC-721](./eip-721.md) and [ERC-1155](./eip-1155.md). Implementations extend from [ERC-7943](./eip-7943) alongside their base standard interface.
*   **Essential enforcement rules:** Includes `forceTransfer` and `setFrozen` as standard functions, acknowledging its importance for regulatory enforcement in the RWA space, distinct from standard transfers. Mandates access control for this sensitive function.
*   **[ERC-165](./eip-165.md):** Ensures implementing contracts can signal support for this interface.

As an example, an AMM pool or a lending protocol can integrate with [ERC-7943](./eip-7943.md) based [ERC-20](./eip-20.md) tokens by calling `isUserAllowed` or `isTransferAllowed` to handle these assets in a compliant manner. Enforcement actions like `forceTransfer` and `setFrozen` can either be called by third party entities or be integrated by external protocols to allow for automated and programmable compliance. Users can then expand these tokens with additional features to fit the specific needs of individual asset types, either with on-chain identity systems, historical balances tracking for dividend distributions, semi-fungibility with token metadata, and other custom functionalities.

### Notes on naming:

- **`forceTransfer`**: This term was selected for its neutrality. While names like "confiscation," "revocation," or "recovery" describe specific motivations, `forceTransfer` purely denotes the direct action of transferring assets, irrespective of the underlying reason.
- **`setFrozen` / `getFrozen`**: These names were chosen for managing transfer restrictions.
    - **Consolidated Approach**: To maintain a lean EIP, a single `setFrozen` function (which overwrites the frozen asset quantity) and one `Frozen` event were favored over distinct `freeze`/`unfreeze` functions and events.
    - **Terminology**: "Frozen" was selected for its general applicability to both fungible (amount-based) and non-fungible (status-based) assets, as terms like "amount" or "asset(s)" might not be universally fitting.
- **`ERC7943InsufficientUnfrozenBalance`**: Discussions around "insufficient" being similar to "unavailable" arose, where "unavailable" might have suggested better a temporal condition like a freezing status. However the term "available"/ "unavailable" was also overlapping with "frozen" / "unfrozen" creating more confusion and duality. Finally, coupling "insufficient" with the specified "unfrozen balance" better represents the domain, prefix and subject of the error, according to [ERC-6093](./eip-6093.md) guidelines.

## Backwards Compatibility

This EIP defines a new interface standard and does not alter existing ones like [ERC-20](./eip-20.md), [ERC-721](./eip-721.md) and [ERC-1155](./eip-1155.md). Standard wallets and explorers can interact with the base token functionality of implementing contracts, subject to the rules enforced by that contract's implementation of `isUserAllowed`, `isTransferAllowed` and `getFrozen` functions. Full support for the [ERC-7943](./eip-7943.md) functions requires explicit integration.

## Reference Implementation

Examples of basic implementation for [ERC-20](./eip-20.md), [ERC-721](./eip-721.md) and [ERC-1155](./eip-1155.md) which include a basic whitelist for users and an enumerable role based access control:

## Security Considerations

*   **Access Control for `forceTransfer` and `setFrozen`:** The security of the mechanism chosen by the implementer to restrict access to these functions is paramount. Unauthorized access could lead to asset theft. Secure patterns (multisig, timelocks) are highly recommended. The `setFrozen` function might be susceptible to front-running, similar to the `approve` function of the [ERC-20](./eip-20.md). Additional features to gradually increment or decrement the frozen status CAN be considered for implementation.
*   **Implementation Logic:** The correctness of the *implementation* behind all interface functions is critical. Flaws in this logic could bypass intended transfer restrictions or incorrectly block valid transfers.
*   **Standard Contract Security:** Implementations MUST adhere to general smart contract security best practices (reentrancy guards where applicable, checks-effects-interactions, etc.). Specifically in the checks-effects-interactions consideration, implementations need to be aware of tokens having hooks, especially on recipients like in [ERC-721](./eip-721.md) or [ERC-1155](./eip-1155.md). In such circumstances it might be convenient to adopt reentrancy guards to prevent unwanted executions.
