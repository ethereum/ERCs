## Abstract

This ERC defines a standardized method for attributing transactions to applications, wallets, and other entities through structured data suffixes appended to transaction calldata. The standard enables interoperable attribution tracking, supports multiple entity attribution per transaction, and provides a mechanism for reward distribution through registered payout addresses.

## Motivation

Currently, applications informally append "data suffixes" to transactions to indicate their origin, typically using the first bytes of a hash representing the application name. For example, Coinbase adds `keccak256("CoinbaseSmartWallet")` to transactions from keys.coinbase.com, and apps like Zora and OpenSea employ similar approaches.

This ad-hoc approach presents several limitations:

1. **Non-interoperable attribution**: Each application uses custom suffix formats, requiring explicit checks for specific patterns to detect attributions
2. **Opaque identification**: Hash-based suffixes obscure the actual application identity, making attribution analysis difficult
3. **Reward distribution challenges**: Even when an application is identified, there's no standardized way to determine where to send rewards
4. **Limited multi-entity support**: No clear mechanism for attributing transactions to multiple entities (e.g., both application and wallet)
5. **Lack of extensibility**: No standardized way to query additional metadata about attributed entities

This standard addresses these issues by providing a structured, extensible format for transaction attribution that supports multiple entities, reward distribution, and metadata discovery.

## Specification

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.

### Data Suffix Schema

This standard defines a structured data suffix format appended to transaction calldata. The suffix consists of the following components (ordered from end of calldata backwards):

1. **ercSuffix** (16 bytes): A special identifier value indicating use of this standard ("8021" repeated)
2. **schemaId** (1 byte): Schema ID number that declares the schema of proceeding bytes with space for forwards compatibility
3. **schemaData** (variable bytes): Data to be parsed according to `schemaId`

A `schemaId` MUST have an associated ERC to be considered valid.

### Multi-Attribution Schemas

Our first schemas enable attributing multiple entities in a single transaction.

Entities are identified by a unique "code" which is a string that follows 7-bit ASCII encoding. A code MUST NOT contain commas (`0x2C`) as this is reserved as a delimitter for attributing multiple codes.

Codes MUST also be registered in a Code Regsitry smart contract (interface defined in later section). Chains are encouraged to provide canonical code registries which MAY be defined in this or future ERCs.

Schema ID `0` defines the following bytes and assumes chain's canonical Code Registry:
1. **codesLength** (1 byte): Length of the codes array in bytes, including delimiters
2. **codes** (variable length): Array of attribution codes using ASCII encoding with comma (`0x2C`) as delimiter

Schema ID `1` builds on top of `0`, but also defines a custom Code Registry
1. **codesLength** (1 byte): Length of the codes array in bytes, including delimiters
2. **codes** (variable length): Array of attribution codes using ASCII encoding with comma (`0x2C`) as delimiter
3. **codeRegistryAddress** (20 bytes): Address of a smart contract implementing `ICodeRegistry`

#### Examples

The complete suffix format is:
```
{txData}{schemaData}{schemaId}{ercSuffix}
```

Single entity attribution with canonical registry:
```
{txData}{"baseapp"}{7}{0}{0x80218021802180218021802180218021}
```

Multiple entity attribution with custom registry:
```
{txData}{0xCodeRegistry}{"baseapp,morpho"}{14}{1}{0x80218021802180218021802180218021}
```

### Parsing Algorithm

Offchain parsers SHOULD implement the following algorithm:

1. Extract the last TBD bytes as `ercSuffix` and verify it matches the standard identifier
2. Extract the previous byte as `schemaId`
3. If `schemaId` is `0`:
   a. Extract the previous byte as `codesLength`
   b. Extract the previous `codesLength` bytes as `codes`
   c. Implicitly set `codeRegistryAddress` as the registry defined by the host chain
   d. Parse `codes` using `0x2C` (comma) as delimiter between codes
   e. Query code-related data from `codeRegistryAddress`
3. If `schemaId` is `1`:
   a. Extract the previous byte as `codesLength`
   b. Extract the previous `codesLength` bytes as `codes`
   c. Extract the previous 20 bytes as custom `codeRegistryAddress`
   d. Parse `codes` using `0x2C` (comma) as delimiter between codes
   e. Query code-related data from `codeRegistryAddress`
4. Else `schemaId` does not match, parsing SHOULD terminate (unknown schemaId)

### Code Registry Interface

A Code Registry MUST implement the following interface:

```solidity
interface ICodeRegistry {
    /// @notice Fetch a code's address to payout incentives
    /// @param code The code to query
    /// @return The address to receive rewards for this code
    function payoutAddress(string memory code) external view returns (address);
    
    /// @notice Fetch a code's URI to fetch for additional metadata
    /// @param code The code to query  
    /// @return The URI pointing to metadata about this code
    function codeURI(string memory code) external view returns (string memory);
    
    /// @notice Check if a code is valid format (characters, length, etc)
    /// @dev MUST return false if code is empty string
    /// @param code The code to query
    /// @return True if the code is valid, false otherwise
    function isValidCode(string memory code) external view returns (bool);
    
    /// @notice Check if a code is registered
    /// @param code The code to query
    /// @return True if the code is registered, false otherwise
    function isRegistered(string memory code) external view returns (bool);
}
```

### Code Regsitry Canonical Addresses

| Chain ID | Code Registry |
| -------- | ------------- |
| `8453`   | TBD           |
| `84532`  | TBD           |

### Code Metadata

Querying `CodeRegistry.codeURI(code)` returns a string `uri` to fetch actual metadata, following from NFT patterns. The returned metadata SHOULD include these fields:

```typescript
type CodeMetadata = {
    app: {
      name: string
      url: string
    }
}
```

Future ERCs can extend this schema.

### ERC-5792 Integration

Applications using ERC-5792's `wallet_sendCalls` RPC method MUST communicate attribution data through a new capability:

```typescript
interface DataSuffixCapability {
  dataSuffix: string; // Hex-encoded bytes to append as suffix
}
```

Wallets implementing this capability MUST append the provided `dataSuffix` bytes to the transaction calldata. Wallets MAY optionally insert their own attribution code before the application's suffix if they understand this standard.

### ERC-4337 User Operation Implementation

For ERC-4337 compliant smart accounts, the implementation differs from normal Ethereum transactions:

**Normal Transactions**: The attribution suffix is appended to the `data` field of the top-level Ethereum transaction.

**ERC-4337 User Operations**: The attribution suffix MUST be appended to the `userOp.callData` field instead of the transaction-level data field, since smart account transactions are executed through the EntryPoint contract where the actual call data is contained within the user operation structure.

When implementing attribution for smart accounts:

1. Applications SHOULD append the suffix to `userOp.callData` when constructing user operations
2. Parsers MUST examine the `callData` field of user operations rather than transaction data when processing ERC-4337 transactions
3. Wallets supporting both EOA and smart account transactions MUST handle suffix appending appropriately based on the account type

This ensures attribution data remains accessible and parseable regardless of whether the transaction originates from an externally owned account (EOA) or a smart contract account following ERC-4337.

## Rationale

### Design Decisions

**Reverse-order parsing**: The suffix format is designed for parsing from the end of calldata backwards, enabling efficient detection of attribution without requiring knowledge of the original calldata length.

**schemaId byte**: Including a schemaId field enables future extensions and optimizations in minimizing attribution data.

**Registry pattern**: Using a registry contract allows entities to update their payout addresses and metadata without requiring transaction format changes.

**ASCII encoding**: Using human-readable ASCII codes improves debuggability and allows for meaningful code names rather than opaque hashes.

**ERC-5792 integration**: The capability-based approach aligns with ERC-5792's extensible design while providing a clean separation of concerns between applications and wallets.

### Alternative Approaches Considered

**Customizable registry**: While a single global registry is recommended when available for reduced transaction data, the flexible registry approach allows different ecosystems to maintain their own attribution systems.

**Fixed-length codes**: A fixed-length encoding was considered but rejected to allow for flexible, human-readable identifiers.

**ERC-721 dependency**: While codes may be implemented as ERC-721 NFTs, reducing strict dependencies makes this proposal more flexible and clarifies the minimal interface truly required for attribution.

**Structured ERC-5792 capability**: A generic bytes `dataSuffix` minimizes the effort on wallets to integrate and maintain support for new schemaIds, increasing chances of wide adoption.

## Backwards Compatibility

This standard is fully backward compatible with existing transaction formats. Transactions without attribution suffixes continue to function normally, and the presence of attribution data does not affect transaction execution.

Existing applications using informal attribution methods can migrate to this standard while maintaining their current functionality during the transition period.

## Security Considerations

### Parsing Safety

Parsers MUST validate the suffix format before processing to prevent malformed data from causing errors. Invalid suffixes SHOULD be ignored rather than causing parsing failures.

### Registry Trust

The security of attribution data depends on the trustworthiness of the registry contract. Users and applications SHOULD verify the registry implementation and governance before relying on its data.

### Data Integrity

Since attribution data is appended to calldata, it could potentially be modified by intermediaries. Applications requiring cryptographic proof of attribution should implement additional signature-based verification mechanisms.

### Privacy Considerations

Attribution data is publicly visible on-chain. Applications handling sensitive user information SHOULD NOT include identifying information in attribution codes.

## Test Cases

Single entity attribution + canonical registry:
```

Expected: 
- txData: 0xdddddddd
- schemaId: 0
- codes: ["baseapp"]
- registry: canonical
```

Multiple entity attribution + custom registry:
```
Input: 0xdddddddd626173656170702C6D6F7270686F12cccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccc0180218021802180218021802180218021
Expected:
- txData: 0xdddddddd
- schemaId: 0
- codes: ["baseapp", "morpho"]
- registry: 0xcccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccc
```

Invalid schemaId handling:
```
Input: 0xddddddddff80218021802180218021802180218021
Expected: Parsing stops, unknown schemaId
```
