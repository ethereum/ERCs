## Abstract

This standard introduces a minimal interface, `IERC7802`, for tokens to enable standardized cross-chain communication. The interface consists of two functions, `crosschainMint` and `crosschainBurn`, which allow authorized bridge contracts to mint and burn token representations during cross-chain transfers. These functions serve as the entry points for bridge logic, enabling consistent handling of token supply across chains.

The interface also defines two standardized events, `CrosschainMint` and `CrosschainBurn`, which emit metadata, including the target address, token amount, and caller. These events facilitate deterministic indexing and monitoring of cross-chain activities by off-chain agents, such as indexers, analytics tools, and auditors.

`IERC7802` is intentionally lightweight, ensuring minimal overhead for implementation. Its modular design enables extensibility, allowing additional features—such as mint/burn limits, transfer fees, or bridge-specific access control mechanisms—to be layered on top without modifying the base interface. 

## Motivation

All rollups and multiple important sidechains (Gnosis and Polygon PoS, among others) implement canonical bridges that embed their security into some part of the network's core architecture. These bridges do not have mint/burn rights over original tokens, so they usually lock (unlock) liquidity on the native chain and then mint (burn) a non-equivalent representation on the other. Mint/burn is used because the native token is non-existent on that side, so they must create a new representation. However, each bridge implements a different interface for minting/burning on non-native chains.

This interface fragmentation is a massive issue in cross-chain communication among chains via third-party bridges or future canonical solutions. At this point, it is clear that every bridge would benefit from a standardized interface for minted/burnt tokens. 

There have been different attempts in the past to standardize token-bridging interfaces. However, third-party providers are also developing cross-chain token frameworks. Each framework defines its features, like rate limits and fee switches, and implements its mint and burn versions. The resultant interfaces become highly specific, lacking naming conventions and structures.

The proposed interface includes the most relevant and minimal set of actions used by most of these standards. These actions also do not require any governance or owner participation, in contrast, for instance, to set rate limits.

## Specification

This ERC introduces the `IERC7802` interface.

### Interface Identification

The interface identifier for `IERC7802` is **`0x33331994`**, calculated according to [ERC-165](./eip-165.md) as the XOR of the function selectors of the two functions in the interface:

```solidity
bytes4 constant INTERFACE_ID_IERC7802 = 
        bytes4(keccak256("crosschainMint(address,uint256)")) ^
        bytes4(keccak256("crosschainBurn(address,uint256)"));
```

or via Solidity as 

```solidity
type(IERC7802).interfaceId
```

Implementors MUST ensure that the `supportsInterface` method of ERC-165 returns true for this interface ID to indicate support for `IERC7802`.


### Methods

**`crosschainMint`**

Mints `_amount` of token to address `_account`. 

This function works as the minting entry point for bridge contracts. Each implementation is responsible for its access control logic.

```solidity
function crosschainMint(address _account, uint256 _amount) external;
```

Implementations SHOULD emit `Transfer(address(0), _to, _amount)` on calls to `crosschainMint` to be compliant with [ERC-20](./eip-20.md) invariants on token creation.

**`crosschainBurn`**

Burns `_amount` of token from address `_account`.

This function works as the burning entry point for bridge contracts. Each implementation is responsible for its access control logic.

```solidity
function crosschainBurn(address _account, uint256 _amount) external;
```

Implementations might consider emitting `Transfer(_from, address(0), _amount)` on calls to `crosschainBurn` to be compliant with [ERC-5679](./eip-5679.md).

### Events

**`CrosschainMint`**

MUST trigger when `crosschainMint` is successfully called. 
The `_sender` parameter MUST be set to the msg.sender at the time the function is called.

```solidity
event CrosschainMint(address indexed _to, uint256 _amount, address indexed _sender);
```

**`CrosschainBurn`**

MUST trigger when `crosschainBurn` is successfully called.
The `_sender` parameter MUST be set to the msg.sender at the time the function is called.

```solidity
event CrosschainBurn(address indexed _from, uint256 _amount, address indexed _sender)
```

## Rationale

### Design philosophy
The core design decisions behind this minimal interface are

- Bridge agnosticism.
- Extensibility.

**Bridge agnosticism**
This interface is designed so bridges, not tokens, contain the logic to process cross-chain actions. By maintaining this separation of concerns, token contracts remain simple, reducing their attack surface and easing auditing and upgradability. Offloading cross-chain complexities to bridge contracts ensures that tokens do not embed specific bridge logic.

By implementing the proposed interface, tokens can be supported by different bridge designs:

- Lock/unlock bridges can still operate and do not require any token modification.
- Burn/mint bridges can now use a universal and minimal token interface, so they will not need to introduce bridge-specific representations, improving cross-chain fungibility.

**Extensibility**
The minimal interface serves as a foundational layer upon which other standards can be built.
Token issuers or bridge contracts can extend functionality by adding features such as mint/burn limits, cross-chain transfer fees, and more without altering the core interface.

The interface is intentionally neutral and does not impose conditions on:

- **Access Control**: Token issuers determine who is authorized to call `crosschainMint()` and `crosschainBurn()`.
- **Zero Amount Calls**: Token issuers decide whether to allow or revert calls with zero amounts.

### Separation of Local and Cross-Chain Minting/Burning

**Different actions**

Local minting and burning are fundamentally different from cross-chain minting and burning.

- In cross-chain operations, the total circulating supply across all chains is expected to remain constant, as tokens are transferred between chains rather than created or destroyed in isolation.
- Agents that mint and burn tokens in cross-chain transfer fundamentally differ from token owners. It make sense for the two actors to have different permissions.

Therefore, it is reasonable to have different checks, access controls, and logic (such as mint/burn limits) for cross-chain actions.

**Separation of concerns**

Merging local and cross-chain minting/burning into the same functions can lead to complex implementations that intertwine different operational logic. 
By splitting into two, concerns remain separate, making the codebase cleaner and more maintainable.

This separation of concerns is particularly relevant for

- Upgrades: Any changes in access control, limits, or logic will only affect the separate cross-chain functions (`crosschainMint` and `crosschainBurn`) without altering the standard local mint and burn implementations.
- Integrations with Different Chains: To make an [ERC-20](./eip-20.md) cross-chain compatible,
issuers simply need to implement the [ERC-7802](./eip-7802.md) extension with the corresponding access controls for each chain. 
For example, when integrating with Optimism, the ERC-20 would grant access to the Optimism bridge; when integrating with Arbitrum, it would grant access to the Arbitrum bridge. 
The local mint and burn functions remain unchanged. 
Using dedicated functions for cross-chain operations provides a more modular approach, avoiding the need to modify the base implementation for each chain.

**Dedicated events**

A similar reasoning applies to having dedicated cross-chain-specific events. The separation significantly facilitates the work of indexers, analytics tools, and auditors. It allows for straightforward tracking of cross-chain activities, detecting anomalies, and monitoring bridge operations. If cross-chain and local events are indistinguishable, off-chain agents must implement complex logic to differentiate them, increasing the potential for errors and inefficiencies.

### ERC-165 Interface

The inclusion of ERC-165 provides an additional security check for integrators. By providing the interface identifier through the `supportsInterface` method, callers can programmatically confirm that the token adheres to the `IERC7802` interface. 
This verification ensures that the token supports both `crosschainMint` and `crosschainBurn` functions, preventing scenarios where only one function is implemented. Such incomplete implementations could lead to issues like users burning tokens to bridge out but being unable to mint them upon return, resulting in failed cross-chain actions.

It is important to note that this check can only be performed locally on the chain where the token contract resides. There is no inherent guarantee that the token on the receiving chain also supports the `IERC7802` interface. Ensuring cross-chain consistency of interface support is the responsibility of the bridge implementation.

## Backwards Compatibility

This proposal is fully backwards compatible with [ERC-20](./eip-20.md).

As discussed in the Motivation section, a minimal, flexible cross-chain standard interface is necessary. The problem becomes larger as more tokens are deployed without a standardized format.

- Upgradable tokens can be upgraded to implement the new interface.
- Non-upgradable tokens cannot implement the interface on the token itself. They can still migrate to a standard-compliant version using a lockbox mechanism, as proposed by xERC-20. The idea is to lock non-mintable tokens and mint the same amount of interface-compliant tokens. The bridge contract can act as a lockbox on the native chain.

Bridge contracts will also need an upgrade to integrate with the interface.

## Security Considerations

Token issuers are responsible for controlling which contracts are authorized to call the `crosschainMint()` and `crosschainBurn()` functions. A buggy or malicious authorized caller could mint or burn tokens improperly, damaging token holders and disrupting integrations.

One method to minimize potential losses is introducing mint/burn limits, as proposed by xERC-20. These features are fully compatible with the proposed interface.
