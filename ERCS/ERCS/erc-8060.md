## Abstract

This proposal introduces [`IERC721Value`](#specification), an extension to [ERC-721](./eip-721.md) that enables each non-fungible token to natively hold and represent verifiable ETH value within its contract logic.  
Unlike wrapped or delegated approaches, this mechanism embeds ETH directly into the NFT itself, creating a new class of ETH-backed cultural assets.

---

## Motivation

Today, NFTs represent ownership of digital assets but do not hold intrinsic value.  
`IERC721Value` allows each token to embed and maintain a direct ETH collateral balance, binding cultural, artistic, or symbolic meaning to real on-chain economic weight.  
This creates a new paradigm of *ETH-reservoir assets* that act as verifiable stores of cultural and financial energy.

## Specification

The interface extends [ERC-721](./eip-721.md) as follows:

```solidity
interface IERC721Value is IERC721 {
    /// @notice Returns the amount of ETH embedded in the given tokenId.
    function valueOf(uint256 tokenId) external view returns (uint256);

    /// @notice Allows minting a token with embedded ETH value.
    function mintWithValue(address to, uint256 tokenId) external payable;

    /// @notice Burns a token and refunds its embedded ETH value to the owner.
    function burn(uint256 tokenId) external;
}
