## Simple Summary
An extension to the [ERC-20] standard token that allows Token wallet owners to request a wallet to be funded, by calling the smart contract and attaching a fund instruction string.

## Actors

#### Token Wallet Owners
The person or company who owns the wallet, and will order a token fund request into the wallet.

#### Token contract owner / agent 
The entity, company responsible/owner of the token contract, and token issuing/minting. This actor is in charge of trying to fulfill all fund request(s), reading the fund instruction(s), and correlate the private payment details.

#### Orderer
An actor who is enabled to initiate funding orders on behalf of a token wallet owner.

## Abstract
Token wallet owners (or approved addresses) can order tokenization requests through  blockchain. This is done by calling the ```orderFund``` or ```orderFundFrom``` methods, which initiate the workflow for the token contract operator to either honor or reject the fund request. In this case, fund instructions are provided when submitting the request, which are used by the operator to determine the source of the funds to be debited in order to do fund the token wallet (through minting).

In general, it is not advisable to place explicit routing instructions for debiting funds on a verbatim basis on the blockchain, and it is advised to use a private communication alternatives, such as private channels, encrypted storage or similar,  to do so (external to the blockchain ledger). Another (less desirable) possibility is to place these instructions on the instructions field in encrypted form.

## Motivation
Nowadays most of the token issuing/funding request, based on any fiat based payment method  need a previous centralized transaction, to be able to get the desired tokens issued on requester's wallet.
In the aim of trying to bring all the needed steps into decentralization, exposing all the needed steps of token lifecycle and payment transactions, a funding request can allow wallet owner to initiate the funding request via  blockchain.
Key benefits:

* Funding and payment traceability is enhanced bringing the initiation into the ledger. All payment stat
s can be stored on chain.
* Almost all money/token lifecycle is covered via a decentralized approach, complemented with private communications which is common use in the ecosystem.

## Rationale
This standards provides a functionality to allow token holders to start funding requests in a decentralized way.

It's important to highlight that the token operator, need to process all funding request, updating the fund status based on the linked payment that will be done.

Funding instruction format is open. ISO payment standard like is a good start point,

The `operationId` is a string and not something more gas efficient to allow easy traceability of the hold and allow human readable ids. It is up to the implementer if the string should be stored on-chain or only its hash, as it is enough to identify a hold.

The `operationId` is a competitive resource. It is recommended, but not required, that the hold issuers used a unique prefix to avoid collisions.

## Backwards Compatibility
This EIP is fully backwards compatible as its implementation extends the functionality of [ERC-20].

## Implementation
The GitHub repository [IoBuilders/fundable-token](https://github.com/IoBuilders/fundable-token) contains the work in progress implementation.
