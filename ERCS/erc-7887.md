## Abstract

The following standard extends [ERC-7540](./eip-7540.md) by adding support for asynchronous cancelation flows.

New methods are added to asynchronously cancel a deposit or redeem Request, view the status of the cancelation Request, and claim the assets or shares as a result of the cancelation Request.

## Motivation

Shares or assets locked for Requests can be stuck in the Pending state. For some use cases, such as redeeming from a pool of long-dated real-world assets, this can take a considerable amount of time.

This standard expands the scope of Asynchronous ERC-7540 Vaults by adding cancelation support.

## Specification

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.

### Definitions

The existing definitions from [ERC-7540](./eip-7540.md) apply.

### Cancelation Lifecycle

After submission, cancelation Requests go through Pending, Claimable, and Claimed stages. An example lifecycle for a deposit cancelation Request is visualized in the table below.

| **State**   | **User**                         | **Vault** |
|-------------|---------------------------------|-----------|
| Pending     | `cancelDepositRequest(requestId, controller)` | `pendingCancelDepositRequest[controller] = true` |
| Claimable   |                                 | *Internal cancelation fulfillment*:  `pendingCancelDepositRequest[controller] = false`; `claimableCancelDepositRequest[controller] = assets` |
| Claimed     | `claimCancelDepositRequest(requestId, receiver, controller)`      | `claimableDepositRequest[controller] -= assets`; `asset.balanceOf[receiver] += assets` |

`pendingCancelDepositRequest` and `claimableCancelDepositRequest` are defined in the [Methods](#methods) section.

Requests MUST NOT skip or otherwise short-circuit the Claim state. In other words, to initiate and claim a Request, a user MUST call both cancel* and the corresponding Claim function separately, even in the same block. Vaults MUST NOT "push" tokens onto the user after a Request, users MUST "pull" the tokens via the Claim function.

Requests MAY skip straight from the Pending to the Claimable stage, in the case of synchronous cancelation flows.

While a deposit cancelation Request is Pending, new deposit Requests are blocked. Likewise, while a redeem cancelation Request is Pending, new redeem Requests are blocked.

### Methods

#### `cancelDepositRequest`

Submits a Request for asynchronous deposit cancelation. This places the Request in Pending state, with a corresponding increase in `pendingCancelDepositRequest` for the full amount of the pending deposit Request. 

When the cancelation is Pending, new deposit Requests are blocked and `requestDeposit` MUST revert.

When the cancelation is Claimable, `claimableCancelDepositRequest` will be increased for the `controller`. `claimCancelDepositRequest` can subsequently be called by `controller` to receive `assets`. A Request MAY transition straight to Claimable state but MUST NOT skip the Claimable state.

`controller` MUST equal `msg.sender` unless the `controller` has approved the `msg.sender` as an operator.

MUST emit the `CancelDepositRequest` event.

```yaml
- name: cancelDepositRequest
  type: function
  stateMutability: nonpayable

  inputs:
    - name: requestId
      type: uint256
    - name: controller
      type: address
  outputs:
```

#### `pendingCancelDepositRequest`

Whether the given `requestId` and `controller` have a pending deposit cancelation Request.

MUST NOT show any variations depending on the caller.

MUST NOT revert unless due to integer overflow caused by an unreasonably large input.

```yaml
- name: pendingCancelDepositRequest
  type: function
  stateMutability: view

  inputs:
    - name: requestId
      type: uint256
    - name: controller
      type: address

  outputs:
    - name: isPending
      type: bool
```

#### `claimableCancelDepositRequest`

The amount of `assets` in Claimable cancelation state for the `controller` to claim.

MUST NOT show any variations depending on the caller.

MUST NOT revert unless due to integer overflow caused by an unreasonably large input.

```yaml
- name: claimableCancelDepositRequest
  type: function
  stateMutability: view

  inputs:
    - name: requestId
      type: uint256
    - name: controller
      type: address

  outputs:
    - name: assets
      type: uint256
```

#### `claimCancelDepositRequest`

Claims the deposit cancelation Request with `requestId` and `controller`.

Transfers `assets` to `receiver`.

`controller` MUST equal `msg.sender` unless the `controller` has approved the `msg.sender` as an operator.

MUST emit the `ClaimCancelDepositRequest` event.

```yaml
- name: claimCancelDepositRequest
  type: function
  stateMutability: nonpayable

  inputs:
    - name: requestId
      type: uint256
    - name: receiver
      type: address
    - name: controller
      type: address
  outputs:
```

#### `cancelRedeemRequest`

Submits a Request for asynchronous redeem cancelation. This places the Request in Pending state, with a corresponding increase in `pendingCancelRedeemRequest` for the full amount of the pending redeem Request. 

When the cancelation is Pending, new redeem Requests are blocked and `requestRedeem` MUST revert.

When the cancelation is Claimable, `claimableCancelRedeemRequest` will be increased for the `controller`. `claimCancelRedeemRequest` can subsequently be called by `controller` to receive `shares`. A Request MAY transition straight to Claimable state but MUST NOT skip the Claimable state.

`controller` MUST equal `msg.sender` unless the `controller` has approved the `msg.sender` as an operator.

MUST emit the `CancelRedeemRequest` event.

```yaml
- name: cancelRedeemRequest
  type: function
  stateMutability: nonpayable

  inputs:
    - name: requestId
      type: uint256
    - name: controller
      type: address
  outputs:
```

#### `pendingCancelRedeemRequest`

Whether the given `requestId` and `controller` have a pending redeem cancelation Request.

MUST NOT show any variations depending on the caller.

MUST NOT revert unless due to integer overflow caused by an unreasonably large input.

```yaml
- name: pendingCancelRedeemRequest
  type: function
  stateMutability: view

  inputs:
    - name: requestId
      type: uint256
    - name: controller
      type: address

  outputs:
    - name: isPending
      type: bool
```

#### `claimableCancelRedeemRequest`

The amount of `shares` in Claimable cancelation state for the `controller` to claim.

MUST NOT show any variations depending on the caller.

MUST NOT revert unless due to integer overflow caused by an unreasonably large input.

```yaml
- name: claimableCancelRedeemRequest
  type: function
  stateMutability: view

  inputs:
    - name: requestId
      type: uint256
    - name: controller
      type: address

  outputs:
    - name: shares
      type: uint256
```

#### `claimCancelRedeemRequest`

Claims the redeem cancelation Request with `requestId` and `controller`.

Transfers `assets` to `receiver`.

`controller` MUST equal `msg.sender` unless the `controller` has approved the `msg.sender` as an operator.

MUST emit the `ClaimCancelRedeemRequest` event.

```yaml
- name: claimCancelRedeemRequest
  type: function
  stateMutability: nonpayable

  inputs:
    - name: requestId
      type: uint256
    - name: receiver
      type: address
    - name: owner
      type: address
  outputs:
```

### [ERC-165](./eip-165.md) support

Smart contracts implementing this Vault standard MUST implement the [ERC-165](./eip-165.md) `supportsInterface` function.

Asynchronous deposit Vaults with cancelation support MUST return the constant value `true` if `0x8bf840e3` is passed through the `interfaceID` argument.

Asynchronous redemption Vaults with cancelation support MUST return the constant value `true` if `0xe76cffc7` is passed through the `interfaceID` argument.

## Rationale

### Blocking Requests during Cancelation

When `cancelDepositRequest` is called by a `controller`, new deposit Requests are blocked for this `controller`, and the equivalent applies to the redeem flow.

This requirement simplifies the possible states of vaults implementing asynchronous cancelation flows.

The alternative would create possible states where a cancelation is pending and a new deposit Request is triggered, leading to the current state being complex to read for integrators.

### Mandated Support for [ERC-165](./eip-165.md)

Implementing support for [ERC-165](./eip-165.md) is mandated because of the optionality of flows as defined in [ERC-7540](./eip-7540.md). Integrations can use the `supportsInterface` method to check whether a vault is fully asynchronous, partially asynchronous, or fully synchronous (for which it is just following the [ERC-4626](./eip-4626)), and use a single contract to support all cases.

## Backwards Compatibility

The interface is fully backwards compatible with [ERC-7540](./eip-7540.md).

## Security Considerations

Existing security considerations from [ERC-7540](./eip-7540.md) apply.
