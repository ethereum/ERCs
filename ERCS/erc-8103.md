## Abstract

This EIP defines a **Permissioned Authorization Object (PPO)**: an [EIP-712](./eip-712.md) typed struct describing a *bounded, revocable permission to pull tokens* from a grantor.

A PPO is:

- signed off-chain by the **grantor**,
- specifies the **grantee**, **token**, **per-call cap**, **time window**, and **nonce**,
- portable across chains and executors that adopt the same type,
- revocable prior to execution by invalidating the nonce.

It does **not** prescribe how transfers are executed; that is defined by a separate EIP ("Permissioned Pull", [ERC-8102](./eip-8102.md)).

## Motivation

Today, [ERC-20](./eip-20.md) and related standards lack a canonical primitive for *fine-grained pull permissions*.

We have:

- `transfer` — one-shot push
- `approve/transferFrom` — persistent allowance, but:
  - often infinite,
  - not time-bounded,
  - not natively portable across chains,
  - approvals live in token contract state (harder to audit/rotate)
- `permit` ([EIP-2612](./eip-2612.md)) — signed approvals, but tightly coupled to token contracts

What is missing is a **chain-agnostic, revocable authorization object** that:

- encodes *bounded* consent in a single signed payload,
- can be verified by any compliant executor contract,
- is easy for wallets and AA stacks to reason about,
- can be revoked before use,
- composes with any ERC-20 token without requiring token changes.

This EIP specifies such an authorization struct and its hashing rules, so that:

- executors (ERC-8102) can implement a common verification model,
- registries and wallets can expose and revoke PPOs consistently,
- systems can build higher-level coordination (subscriptions, automation) on a shared authorization primitive.

## Specification

### EIP-712 Type Definition

The canonical type for a Permissioned Authorization Object is:

```text
Authorization(
  address grantor,
  address grantee,
  address token,
  uint256 maxPerPull,
  uint256 validAfter,
  uint256 validBefore,
  bytes32 nonce
)
```

Where:

- `grantor`: address providing consent (token owner).
- `grantee`: address allowed to initiate pulls under this authorization.
- `token`: ERC-20 token address.
- `maxPerPull`: maximum number of `token` units that may be pulled per execution.
- `validAfter`: unix timestamp (seconds) from which this authorization becomes valid (inclusive).
- `validBefore`: unix timestamp (seconds) after which this authorization is no longer valid (exclusive).
- `nonce`: unique value chosen by the grantor for replay protection.

#### TYPEHASH (normative)

The canonical `AUTH_TYPEHASH` MUST be:

```solidity
bytes32 public constant AUTH_TYPEHASH = keccak256(
  "Authorization(address grantor,address grantee,address token,uint256 maxPerPull,uint256 validAfter,uint256 validBefore,bytes32 nonce)"
);
```

#### Struct Hash (normative)

Given:

```solidity
struct Authorization {
    address grantor;
    address grantee;
    address token;
    uint256 maxPerPull;
    uint256 validAfter;
    uint256 validBefore;
    bytes32 nonce;
}
```

The struct hash MUST be computed as:

```solidity
function _authStructHash(Authorization memory a) internal pure returns (bytes32) {
    return keccak256(
        abi.encode(
            AUTH_TYPEHASH,
            a.grantor,
            a.grantee,
            a.token,
            a.maxPerPull,
            a.validAfter,
            a.validBefore,
            a.nonce
        )
    );
}
```

The EIP-712 digest is then:

```solidity
bytes32 digest = keccak256(
    abi.encodePacked(
        "\x19\x01",
        domainSeparator,
        _authStructHash(auth)
    )
);
```

where `domainSeparator` is as defined in EIP-712 by the verifying contract (typically the executor contract specified in ERC-8102).

### Revocation Model

This EIP defines requirements on revocation semantics but does not prescribe storage layout. Implementations MAY use:

- local per-executor storage, and/or
- a shared registry contract, and/or
- wallet-maintained revocation maps.

Normative requirements:

1. Grantors MUST be able to revoke any *unused* `nonce` prior to execution.

2. Executors MUST check revocation status at execution time according to the mechanism adopted by the executor (e.g., local cancellation and/or shared registry).

3. Executors MUST reject revoked or canceled nonces.

Recommended events (names are illustrative):

```solidity
event AuthorizationGranted(
    address indexed grantor,
    address indexed grantee,
    address indexed token,
    bytes32 nonce
);

event AuthorizationRevoked(
    address indexed grantor,
    bytes32 indexed nonce
);
```

Wallets and registries MAY emit these upon signing or revoking PPOs.

### Nonce Semantics

- `nonce` MUST be treated as **single-use** in the context of a given grantor and domain separator.
- Implementations SHOULD treat `(grantor, nonce)` as a unique pair.
- Nonce consumption MUST be race-safe: an executor MUST mark the nonce as used *before* or atomically with any external calls (e.g., token transfers).

### Domain Binding

This EIP intentionally separates:

- the **authorization object** (ERC-8103), and
- the **execution domain** (ERC-8102, pull executor).

Domain binding is achieved in ERC-8102 by including the executor’s `domainSeparator()` in the EIP-712 digest.

This prevents signatures from being replayed across executors with different domains.

### Executor Verification Requirements

Executors verifying PPOs MUST:

- enforce validity windows (`validAfter`, `validBefore`) before execution,
- enforce EIP-2 signature constraints (low-`s`, valid `v`),
- bind verification to their own domain separator.

## Rationale

- **Separation of concerns**: ERC-8103 defines “what is consent?” while ERC-8102 defines “how is consent executed?”. This keeps wallets, AA stacks, and registries decoupled from any specific executor implementation.
- **Stateless across chains**: `maxPerPull` and time windows keep each execution stateless; cumulative limits can be built on top, but are not required at the primitive level.
- **Nonce as bytes32**: Allows flexible schemes (per-grantee, per-token, per-policy) while remaining compatible with simple counter-based patterns.

## Backwards Compatibility

- Compatible with any ERC-20 token; no token changes required.
- Orthogonal to EIP-2612; PPOs are a different authorization path (pull-by-consent vs “permit as approve”).

## Security Considerations

The rules required for safe execution are specified normatively in the Specification section. This section discusses implications:

- Revocation must be checked at execution time to avoid race conditions between revoke and pull.
- Wallet UX should make nonce scope and domain binding clear to users.
- Grantors should protect signing keys; leaked signatures remain valid until expiry or revocation.
