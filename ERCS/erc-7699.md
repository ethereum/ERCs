## Abstract

The [ERC-20](./eip-20.md) token standard does not provide a built-in mechanism for including a payment transfer reference (message for recipient) in token transfers. This proposal extends the existing ERC-20 token standard by adding minimal methods to include a transfer reference in token transfers and transferFrom operations. The addition of a reference can help users, merchants, and service providers to associate and reconcile individual transactions with specific orders or invoices.

## Motivation

The primary motivation for this proposal is to improve the functionality of the ERC-20 token standard by providing a mechanism for including a payment reference in token transfers, similar to the traditional finance systems where payment references are commonly used to associate and reconcile transactions with specific orders, invoices or other financial records.

Currently, users and merchants who want to include a payment reference in their transactions must rely on off chain external systems or custom payment proxy implementations. In traditional finance systems, payment references are often included in wire transfers and other types of electronic payments, making it easy for users and merchants to manage and reconcile their transactions. Such as:

 - SWIFT MT103: field 70 “Remittance Information” is commonly used for such content (e.g " PAYMENT FOR INVOICE 998877"). There is also field 72 “Sender to receiver information”.
 - ISO 20022 (for SEPA): PAIN.001 has field called RmtInf (Remittance Information)

By extending the existing ERC-20 token standard with payment transfer reference capabilities, this proposal will help bridge the gap between traditional finance systems and the world of decentralized finance, providing a more seamless experience for users, merchants, and service providers alike.

## Specification

The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

Any contract complying with ERC-20 when extended with this ERC, MUST implement the following interface:
```
// The EIP-165 identifier of this interface is 0x1522573a

interface IERC7699 {

function transfer(address to, uint256 amount, bytes calldata transferReference) external returns (bool);

function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 amount, bytes calldata transferReference) external returns (bool);

event TransferReference(bytes32 indexed loggedReference);

}
```

These `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions, in addition to the standard transfer behaviour, MUST emit a `transferReference` event with a `loggedReference` parameter (with only exception defined below).

The corresponding ERC-20 `Transfer` event MUST be emitted following the `TransferReference` event, ideally immediately afterwards for the client to be able to seek the associated `Transfer` event log record. 

Emitted `loggedReference` MAY be the exact copy of the `transferReference` (when less then 33 bytes) or the derived data from the rich `transferReference` structure and other processing. This is up to the implementer. One MUST NOT expect the `transferReference` and `loggedReference` data to be equal.

The `loggedReference` parameter MAY contain any data of bytes32 type.

The `transferReference` parameter MAY be empty. In this case and only in this case the `TransferReference` event MUST NOT be emitted, effectively mimicking the regular ERC-20 transfer without any transfer reference. 

The `transferReference` parameter is not limited in length by design, users are motivated to keep it short due to calldata and execution gas costs.

The `TransferReference` event MUST NOT be declared with the `anonymous` specifier. This is to ensure that the event signature is logged and can be used as a filter.

Transfers of 0 amount MUST be treated as normal transfers and fire the `TransferReference` event alike.

## Rationale

### Parameter name

The choice to name the added parameter `transferReference` was made to align with traditional banking terminology, where payment references are widely used to associate and reconcile transactions with specific orders, invoices or other financial records.

The `transferReference` parameter name also helps to clearly communicate the purpose of the parameter and its role in facilitating the association and reconciliation of transactions. By adopting terminology that is well-established in the financial industry, the proposal aims to foster a greater understanding and adoption of the extended ERC-20 token standard.

### Parameter type

The `transferReference` type is bytes.

The `transferReference` type was initially considered to be bytes32 in order to motivate users to either use short references (as is common in TradFi) or rather use Keccak 256 hash of the reference content. Conclusion was that the options should rather be kept open to be able to call with structured data; such as passing reference data including a signature enabling extra processing checks. 

### Emitted data

The `loggedReference` type is bytes32.

It was considered to log a reference in the form of `bytes calldata`.  However, the reference content would be hashed in the event log due to the log topic indexing required for the even subscription filters. The resulting logged topic is always in the form of bytes32. Bytes32 type enables to log publicly readable (non hashed) reference content up to 32 bytes long. 

## Backwards Compatibility

This extension is fully backwards compatible with the existing ERC-20 token standard. The new functions can be used alongside the existing transfer and transferFrom functions. Existing upgradable ERC-20 tokens can be upgraded to include the new functionality without impact on the storage layout; new ERC-20 tokens can choose to implement the payment reference features based on their specific needs.

## Security Considerations

### Privacy Considerations

Reference data privacy: Including payment references in token transfers may expose sensitive information about the transaction or the parties involved. Implementers and users should carefully consider the privacy implications and ensure that payment references do not reveal sensitive information. To mitigate this risk, implementers can consider using encryption or other privacy-enhancing techniques to protect payment reference data.

Example: With reference 0x20240002 logged, transaction is publicly exposing that this is related to the second invoice of the recipient in 2024.

### Manipulation of payment references
There is no validation of the reference data dictated by this ERC. Malicious actors might attempt to manipulate payment references to mislead users, merchants, or service providers. This can lead to:

1. **Legal risks**: The beneficiary may face legal and compliance risks if the attacker uses illicit funds, potentially impersonating or flagging the beneficiary of involvement in money laundering or other illicit activities.
  
2. **Disputes and refunds**: The user might discover they didn't make the payment, request a refund or raise a dispute, causing additional administrative work for the beneficiary.

To mitigate this risk, implementers can consider using methods to identify proper sender and to generate unique and verifiable related payment references. However such implementations are not in the scope of this standard and rather extend it.
