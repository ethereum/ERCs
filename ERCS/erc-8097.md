## Abstract

The *In-Ground Asset Tokenization Standard (In-Ground Asset Token)* provides a unified, machine-verifiable framework for representing natural resources (such as gold, copper, lithium, rare earths, aggregates, hydrocarbons, and other subsurface materials) on Ethereum.

Unlike traditional fungible or non-fungible token standards, in-ground assets require:

- Geological metadata structures derived from technical reports (JORC, NI 43‑101, SAMREC, PERC, S‑K 1300)
- Attestations and signatures from Competent Persons (CP/QP)
- Immutable resource statement anchoring with cryptographic versioning
- Extraction-linked state updates
- Jurisdictional and identity-gated transfers
- ESG, rehabilitation, and bonding primitives

This standard establishes a programmable, compliance-aligned abstraction for in-ground assets bridging geoscience, regulation, and digital asset issuance.

## Motivation

The mining industry lacks unified digital standards for geological provenance, compliance, and depletion-aware representation. Existing token standards fail to encode reserve classifications, extraction dynamics, jurisdictional controls, and ESG obligations.

This standard introduces blockchain-native primitives to address these gaps.

## Specification

### Core Metadata Objects

- **IRO** — In-Ground Resource Object  
- **IGO** — Geology Object  
- **ICO** — Compliance Object  
- **ITO** — Tenure & Jurisdiction Object  
- **IEXO** — Extraction & Depletion Object  
- **IEO** — ESG & Rehabilitation Object  

All objects MUST be hashed (SHA‑256) and anchored on-chain.  
Full metadata MAY be stored off-chain (IPFS, Arweave, Filecoin, or enterprise storage).

### Metadata Object Constraints (Normative)

The following constraints define the minimum feasible implementation requirements:

- **IRO (In-Ground Resource Object)**
  - MUST reference a unique deposit or licensed resource boundary
  - MUST define an initial `totalInGround` quantity
  - MUST NOT be mutable after initial anchoring

- **IGO (Geology Object)**
  - MUST reference a recognized reporting standard
  - MUST be signed by a CP/QP identity
  - MAY be superseded via versioned hash anchoring

- **ICO (Compliance Object)**
  - MUST include jurisdiction identifier
  - MUST include CP/QP attestation metadata
  - MUST be validated prior to enabling transfers

- **IEXO (Extraction & Depletion Object)**
  - MUST track monotonically decreasing `remainingInGround`
  - MUST revert updates that exceed initial reserves
  - MUST emit depletion events

### State Transition Rules

- `setIGAMetadata()` MUST be callable only by authorized issuers or CP/QP delegates
- `recordDepletion()` MUST:
  - Reduce `remainingInGround`
  - Revert if `newRemaining > currentRemaining`
- Transfers MAY be restricted based on compliance or ESG conditions

### Required Functions

```
getIGAMetadata(tokenId)
setIGAMetadata(tokenId, igaHash, cpAddress)
recordDepletion(tokenId, newRemaining)
```

### Optional Token Extensions

- **IGA-T** — Fixed-supply in-ground reserve tokens
- **IGA-X** — Extraction-linked dynamic supply
- **IGA-C** — ESG, rehabilitation, or credit modules

### Geological & Compliance Reporting Standards

This specification references established international mineral reporting and compliance frameworks including:

- JORC – Australasian Joint Ore Reserves Committee Code
- NI 43-101 – Canadian National Instrument 43-101
- SAMREC – South African Mineral Reporting Codes
- PERC – Pan-European Reserves and Resources Reporting Committee
- SEC S-K 1300 – United States SEC mining disclosure standard

These standards define authoritative geological classification, reporting, and compliance requirements which this specification encodes into machine-verifiable digital form.

## Rationale

In-ground assets require depletion-aware, compliance-first modeling not addressed by existing token standards. This specification defines a minimal yet extensible framework to support institutional-grade mineral asset representation.

## Backwards Compatibility

This standard is compatible with ERC‑20, ERC‑721, ERC‑1155, and ERC‑3643 through compositional integration.

## Reference Implementation

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: CC0
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

interface IGAEvents {
    event MetadataUpdated(bytes32 indexed igaHash, address indexed cpAddress);
    event DepletionRecorded(uint256 indexed tokenId, uint256 newRemaining);
}

contract InGroundAssetToken {
    struct IGAMetadata {
        bytes32 igaHash;
        address cpAddress;
        uint256 remainingInGround;
    }

    mapping(uint256 => IGAMetadata) public igaData;

    function setIGAMetadata(
        uint256 tokenId,
        bytes32 igaHash,
        address cpAddress
    ) external {
        igaData[tokenId].igaHash = igaHash;
        igaData[tokenId].cpAddress = cpAddress;
        emit MetadataUpdated(igaHash, cpAddress);
    }

    function recordDepletion(uint256 tokenId, uint256 newRemaining) external {
        igaData[tokenId].remainingInGround = newRemaining;
        emit DepletionRecorded(tokenId, newRemaining);
    }

    function getIGAMetadata(uint256 tokenId)
        external
        view
        returns (IGAMetadata memory)
    {
        return igaData[tokenId];
    }
}
```
## Security Considerations

- CP identity fraud mitigated via DID or attestation standards
- Metadata tampering prevented via cryptographic anchoring
- Oracle manipulation mitigated via multi-sig or decentralized feeds
- Over-issuance prevented via depletion invariants
- Jurisdictional restrictions enforced at transfer level
- ESG obligations enforced via bonded state conditions
