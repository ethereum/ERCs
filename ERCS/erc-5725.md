## Abstract

A **Non-Fungible Token** (NFT) standard used to vest tokens ([ERC-20](./eip-20.md) or otherwise) over a vesting release curve.

The following standard allows for the implementation of a standard API for NFT based contracts that hold and represent the vested and locked properties of any underlying token ([ERC-20](./eip-20.md) or otherwise) that is emitted to the NFT holder. This standard is an extension of the [ERC-721](./eip-721.md) token that provides basic functionality for creating vesting NFTs, claiming the tokens and reading vesting curve properties.

## Motivation

Vesting contracts, including timelock contracts, lack a standard and unified interface, which results in diverse implementations of such contracts. Standardizing such contracts into a single interface would allow for the creation of an ecosystem of on- and off-chain tooling around these contracts. In addition, liquid vesting in the form of non-fungible assets can prove to be a huge improvement over traditional **Simple Agreement for Future Tokens** (SAFTs) or **Externally Owned Account** (EOA)-based vesting as it enables transferability and the ability to attach metadata similar to the existing functionality offered by with traditional NFTs.

Such a standard will not only provide a much-needed [ERC-20](./eip-20.md) token lock standard, but will also enable the creation of secondary marketplaces tailored for semi-liquid SAFTs.

This standard also allows for a variety of different vesting curves to be implement easily.

These curves could represent:

- linear vesting
- cliff vesting
- exponential vesting
- custom deterministic vesting

### Use Cases

1. A framework to release tokens over a set period of time that can be used to build many kinds of NFT financial products such as bonds, treasury bills, and many others.
2. Replicating SAFT contracts in a standardized form of semi-liquid vesting NFT assets.
   - SAFTs are generally off-chain, while today's on-chain versions are mainly address-based, which makes distributing vesting shares to many representatives difficult. Standardization simplifies this convoluted process.
3. Providing a path for the standardization of vesting and token timelock contracts.
   - There are many such contracts in the wild and most of them differ in both interface and implementation.
4. NFT marketplaces dedicated to vesting NFTs.
   - Whole new sets of interfaces and analytics could be created from a common standard for token vesting NFTs.
5. Integrating vesting NFTs into services like Safe Wallet.
   - A standard would mean services like Safe Wallet could more easily and uniformly support interactions with these types of contracts inside of a multisig contract.
6. Enable standardized fundraising implementations and general fundraising that sell vesting tokens (eg. SAFTs) in a more transparent manner.
7. Allows tools, front-end apps, aggregators, etc. to show a more holistic view of the vesting tokens and the properties available to users.
   - Currently, every project needs to write their own visualization of the vesting schedule of their vesting assets. If this is standardized, third-party tools could be developed to aggregate all vesting NFTs from all projects for the user, display their schedules and allow the user to take aggregated vesting actions.
   - Such tooling can easily discover compliance through the [ERC-165](./eip-165.md) `supportsInterface(InterfaceID)` check.
8. Makes it easier for a single wrapping implementation to be used across all vesting standards that defines multiple recipients, periodic renting of vesting tokens etc.

## Rationale

### Terms

These are base terms used around the specification which function names and definitions are based on.

- _vesting_: Tokens which a vesting NFT is vesting until a future date.
- _vested_: Total amount of tokens a vesting NFT has vested.
- _claimable_: Amount of vested tokens which can be unlocked.
- _claimed_: Total amount of tokens unlocked from a vesting NFT.
- _timestamp_: The unix `timestamp` (seconds) representation of dates used for vesting.

### Vesting Functions

**`vestingPayout` + `vestedPayout`**

`vestingPayout(uint256 tokenId)` and `vestedPayout(uint256 tokenId)` add up to the total number of tokens which can be claimed by the end of the vesting schedule. This is also equal to `vestedPayoutAtTime(uint256 tokenId, uint256 timestamp)` with `type(uint256).max` as the `timestamp`.

The rationale for this is to guarantee that the tokens `vested` and tokens `vesting` are always in sync. The intent is that the vesting curves created are deterministic across the `vestingPeriod`. This creates useful opportunities for integration with these NFTs. For example: A vesting schedule can be iterated through and a vesting curve could be visualized, either on-chain or off-chain.

**`vestedPayout` vs `claimedPayout` & `claimablePayout`**

```solidity
vestedPayout - claimedPayout - claimablePayout = lockedPayout
```

- `vestedPayout(uint256 tokenId)` provides the total amount of payout tokens which have **vested** _including `claimedPayout(uint256 tokenId)`_.
- `claimedPayout(uint256 tokenId)` provides the total amount of payout tokens which have been unlocked at the current `timestamp`.
- `claimablePayout(uint256 tokenId)` provides the amount of payout tokens which can be unlocked at the current `timestamp`.

The rationale for providing three functions is to support a number of features:

1. The return of `vestedPayout(uint256 tokenId)` will always match the return of `vestedPayoutAtTime(uint256 tokenId, uint256 timestamp)` with `block.timestamp` as the `timestamp`.
2. `claimablePayout(uint256 tokenId)` can be used to easily see the current payout unlock amount and allow for unlock cliffs by returning zero until a `timestamp` has been passed.
3. `claimedPayout(uint256 tokenId)` is helpful to see tokens unlocked from an NFT and it is also necessary for the calculation of vested-but-locked payout tokens: `vestedPayout - claimedPayout - claimablePayout = lockedPayout`. This would depend on how the vesting curves are configured by the an implementation of this standard.

`vestedPayoutAtTime(uint256 tokenId, uint256 timestamp)` provides functionality to iterate through the `vestingPeriod(uint256 tokenId)` and provide a visual of the release curve. The intent is that release curves are created which makes `vestedPayoutAtTime(uint256 tokenId, uint256 timestamp)` deterministic.

### Timestamps

Generally in Solidity development it is advised against using `block.timestamp` as a state dependent variable as the timestamp of a block can be manipulated by a miner. The choice to use a `timestamp` over a `block` is to allow the interface to work across multiple **Ethereum Virtual Machine** (EVM) compatible networks which generally have different block times. Block proposal with a significantly fabricated timestamp will generally be dropped by all node implementations which makes the window for abuse negligible.

The `timestamp` makes cross chain integration easy, but internally, the reference implementation keeps track of the token payout per Vesting NFT to ensure that excess tokens allotted by the vesting terms cannot be claimed.

### Limitation of Scope

- **Historical claims**: While historical vesting schedules can be determined on-chain with `vestedPayoutAtTime(uint256 tokenId, uint256 timestamp)`, historical claims would need to be calculated through historical transaction data. Most likely querying for `PayoutClaimed` events to build a historical graph.

### Extension Possibilities

These feature are not supported by the standard as is, but the standard could be extended to support these more advanced features.

- **Custom Vesting Curves**: This standard intends on returning deterministic `vesting` values given NFT `tokenId` and a **timestamp** as inputs. This is intentional as it provides for flexibility in how the vesting curves work under the hood which doesn't constrain projects who intend on building a complex smart contract vesting architecture.
- **NFT Rentals**: Further complex DeFi tools can be created if vesting NFTs could be rented.

This is done intentionally to keep the base standard simple. These features can and likely will be added through extensions of this standard.

## Backwards Compatibility

- The Vesting NFT standard is meant to be fully backwards compatible with any current [ERC-721](./eip-721.md) integrations and marketplaces.
- The Vesting NFT standard also supports [ERC-165](./eip-165.md) interface detection for detecting `EIP-721` compatibility, as well as Vesting NFT compatibility.

## Test Cases

The reference vesting NFT repository includes tests written in Hardhat.

## Reference Implementation

A reference implementation of this EIP can be found in [ERC-5725 assets](../assets/eip-5725/README.md).

## Security Considerations

**timestamps**

- Vesting schedules are based on timestamps. As such, it's important to keep track of the number of tokens which have been claimed and to not give out more tokens than allotted for a specific Vesting NFT.
  - `vestedPayoutAtTime(tokenId, type(uint256).max)`, for example, must return the total payout for a given `tokenId`

**approvals**

- When an [ERC-721](./eip-721.md) approval is made on a Vesting NFT, the operator would have the rights to transfer the Vesting NFT to themselves and then claim the vested tokens.
- When a ERC-5725 approval is made on a Vesting NFT, the operator would have the rights to claim the vested tokens, but not transfer the NFT away from the owner.
