## Abstract

This standard proposes a standard implementation as an extension for NFTs - specifically [ERC-721](./erc-721.md) tokens to enable manual and recurring subscription service with auto expiration i.e. Subscription NFTs (hereinafter SubNFTs). The interface includes functions to renew subscription, signal for recurring subscription by signing via Permit2, charge subscription fee automatically as service provider, and cancel the subscription by revoking Permit2 allowance.

## Motivation

NFTs are commonly used as ownership verification on decentralized apps or membership passes to communities, events, and more. However, these use cases often fall into either being a token of ownership that have no expiration dates, or a one-off ticket for verifying identity/reservation thus no recurring payments involved for both cases. However for many real-world applications with paid subscriptions, they would prefer a middle ground - to keep an account or membership valid until the user stops paying for the subscription.

**Currently there exists no standard implementation for service provider to easily configure a subscription, and for users to setup a seamless payment flow via gasless pre-approval for any [ERC-20](./erc-20.md) with an expiry date - while restricting the service provider from automatically charging only by each cycle to keep their subscription active.**

After the introduction of Account Abstraction(AA), even though we can still achieve something similar to gasless pre-approval with the help of [EIP-7702](./eip-7702.md) - user’s EOA will need to delegate to an external contract to act as an smart account which could impose extra security vectors that integrators need to consider, and the subscription feature is still lacking nonetheless. More importantly SubNFTs are in fact compatitable with such smart accounts as long as they are able to receive NFT i.e. with `onERC721Received` implemented thus SubNFTs provide a standardized framework while being AA-compatible for apps to offer subscription features in a more composable way.

Besides a common interface will make it easier for future projects to develop subscription-based NFTs. In the current Web2 world, it's hard for a user to see or manage all of their subscriptions in one place. With a common standard for subscriptions, it will be easy for a single application to determine the number of subscriptions a user has, see when they expire, and renew/cancel them as requested.

Additionally, as the prevalence of secondary royalties from NFT trading disappears, creators will need new models for generating recurring income. For NFTs that act as membership or access passes, pivoting to a subscription-based model is one way to provide income and also incentivizes issuers to keep providing value to their supporters.

## Rationale

This standard aims to make on-chain manual and recurring subscriptions as generic and as easy to integrate with as possible by having minimal configurations for implementing on-chain subscriptions. It is important to note that in this interface, the service provider should be configuring the subscription during deployment - the standard supports multiple plans to enable tierd subscription plans and only using [ERC-20](./erc-20.md) as payment token will enable recurring subscription. The NFT itself represents ownership of a subscription and there is no facilitation of how the NFT should be minted or transferred.

This standard offers a more efficient approach for both users and the platform - rather than forcing users to pay a huge lump sum to tie them into a long subscription plan, or having users lock a fixed amount of funds in advance waiting to be charged each month - users can just spend their funds as they please, and keep enough funds to be deducted by the service provider for the next cycle of subscription without going through a manual subscription process, basically like a debit card for recurring subscription, and more similar to how an auto subscription would work in web2.

### Subscription Management

- **Manual subscription:** Users should be able to renew their subscriptions by directly transferring either native or [ERC-20](./erc-20.md) tokens to the service provider hence the `renewSubscription` function. Users will specify the index of subscription plan i.e. `planIdx` and the number of interval to subscribe for i.e. `numOfIntervals`.

- **Recurring subscription:** Users will start by signing a Permit2 permit to signal the service provider their intent for recurring subscription hence the `signalAutoSubscription` - at this stage the subscription is not active yet, it just indicates the user has approved this contract the total funds needed for the subscription. The service provider will then be able to charge subscription fee automatically by `interval` via `chargeAutoSubscription` to start the subscription for users, no extra subscription fee should be sent to service provider as per the standard's implementation. If the users don't want to continue the subscription they can use `cancelAutoSubscription` to revoke Permit2 allowance, or they can just directly move the funds out from the wallet they signed the permit with.

- `expiresAt` function allows users and applications to directly confirm the validity of a SubNFT by checking its expiration date, and `getSubscriptionDetails` function will get both the expiration date and the subscription plan the SubNFT belongs to.

- `getRenewalPrice` helps users and applications to calculate the price of the subscription given the plan it belongs and the number of intervals the subscription will continue for.

- `isRenewable` function gives users and applications the information whether a subscription for a certain NFT or all NFTs could be renewed once expired.

- `getSubscriptionConfig` will give users and applications the information about the configuration of the subscription such as which payment token, which service provider will receive the subscription fee, how long is each interval is, and the price for each plan.

- Finally it's important to know that only using [ERC-20](./erc-20.md) as payment token can enable recurring subscription as we cannot directly transfer native token on behalf of users without introducing external dependencies.

### Easy Integration

Since this standard is fully [ERC-721](./erc-721.md) compliant, existing protocols will be able to facilitate the transfer of SubNFTs out of the box. With only a minimal configuration and few functions to add, protocols will be able to enable manual or recurring subscription services, fully manage all SubNFTs' subscriptions, check whether a subscription is expired, and decide whether it can be renewed etc.

### Payment compatible with any [ERC-20](./erc-20.md)

This standard integrates with Permit2 - a mechanism introduced by Uniswap to support Permit-like token approval with any [ERC-20](./erc-20.md) so users can gaslessly approve SubNFTs just once in advance to allow service provider automatically charge until a specific time.

## Backwards Compatibility

This standard can be fully [ERC-721](./erc-721.md) compatible by adding an extension function set, and payment can be integrated with any [ERC-20](./erc-20.md) out of the box.

This standard is also fully compatible with smart accounts that utilize Account Abstraction standards such as [EIP-4337](./erc-4337.md) and [EIP-7702](./erc-7702.md) as long as they are able to receive NFT i.e. with `onERC721Received` implemented or with `ERC721Holder.sol` from OpenZeppelin inherited.

## Security Considerations

- This EIP standard does not affect ownership of an NFT
- When integrating with permit-like token approval, to ensure no extra subscription fee would be sent to the service provider, caution should be taken to make sure the spender of the permit is restricted to the SubNFT contract, receiver is restricted to the service provider, and `chargeAutoSubscription` can only be called by each cycle of interval. (details of the implementation can be referenced from the `_ensureValidPermit` checking and `chargeAutoSubscription` above)
- In situation where service provider is charging but the user either has not enough allowance or not enough payment tokens after signing the permit, a graceful exit is suggested by using a try-catch in `chargeAutoSubscription` like above.
