## Abstract

This ERC standardizes how smart contracts can request a **function execution with encrypted arguments**,
optionally with an **encrypted call descriptor**, using a stateless decryption oracle (a *Call Decryption Oracle*).

The goal is to support use-cases like privacy-preserving order books (preventing front-running) or conditional DvP flows,
while keeping the standard itself as generic as possible.

The design is about *when* arguments and call descriptors become visible on-chain, not about
making calls or value flows permanently unlinkable. Once a request is fulfilled, anyone can
correlate the fulfilled call with the original requester via the standardized events.

The ERC defines a data format and contract interface for executing smart contract calls where:

1. The **arguments** are encrypted and reusable and associated with a hash commit for verification (`EncryptedHashedArguments`), and
2. The **call descriptor** (target contract, selector, validity) is either
    - encrypted (`EncryptedCallDescriptor`), or
    - plain (`CallDescriptor`).

An on-chain *call decryption oracle* contract offers a request/fulfill pattern to request a call with an encrypted argument descriptor (*encrypted arguments*), which is fulfilled if admissible.

The *argument descriptor* may contain a list of contracts eligible to request decryption.

The target contract or the call may store a hash commitment to the plaintext arguments and later verifies that the decrypted argument payload matches the stored commitment.

An off-chain *call decryption oracle* listens to standardized events, decrypts payloads, enforces access-control policy, and calls back into the on-chain oracle to perform the requested call.

The ERC is compatible with existing decryption-oracle designs such as [ERC-7573](../EIPS/eip-7573.html) and can be implemented as an extension of such oracles.

The contract receiving the decrypted arguments can pass these on to other contracts, which can, if necessary, validate the arguments against the previously stored **hash commitment**.

The decrypted arguments are transported as `(uint256 requestId, bytes argsPlain)` to allow correlating the call
to the request. Here `argsPlain` is an ABI-encoding of a typed argument list (depending on the business logic).

## Motivation

Privacy- and conditionality-preserving protocols often need to:

- Keep **arguments** confidential until some condition is met (e.g. order books).
- Optionally keep the **target address and function** itself confidential.
- Allow **reusable encrypted argument blobs** that can be passed between contracts and stored on-chain.
- Allow the **receiver** of a call to verify that the decrypted arguments used in the call are exactly those that were committed to earlier.

Existing work like [ERC-7573](./eip-7573.md) focuses on a specific decryption-oracle use-case with fixed callbacks (e.g. DvP).
This ERC generalizes that pattern to a **generic function execution** mechanism, designed around:

- a clear separation of **argument encryption** and **call encryption**, and
- an explicit hash commitment enabling verification of the arguments by the receiving contract.

### Exemplary Use-Cases

#### Order Book Build Process avoiding Front Running

A possible use-case is the construction of an auction / order book preventing front-running, where
the proposals can be made during a predefined phase.
Here participants submit their proposals as encrypted hashed arguments, which are stored inside a smart
contract. Once the order phase is closed, the smart contract calls the *call decryption oracle* (passing
itself as the callback target) to receive the decrypted arguments in a call that will build the order book.

## Specification

### 1. Encrypted arguments

Encrypted arguments are independent of any particular call descriptor and can be reused.

Upon (off-chain) encryption (initialization) a hash of the (plain) arguments is generated
accompanying the encrypted arguments to allow later verification.

```solidity
struct EncryptedHashedArguments {
    /**
     * Commitment to the plaintext argument payload.
     * The target contract should check keccak256(argsPlain) == argsHash.
     */
    bytes32 argsHash;

    /**
     * Identifier of the public key used for encryption (e.g. keccak256 of key material).
     */
    bytes32 publicKeyId;

    /**
     * Ciphertext of abi.encode(ArgsDescriptor), encrypted under publicKeyId.
     */
    bytes ciphertext;
}
```

#### Normative requirements (EncryptedHashedArguments)

For producers of `EncryptedHashedArguments`:

- The producer **MUST** compute

  ```solidity
  argsHash = keccak256(argsPlain);
  ```

  where `argsPlain` is an `abi.encode(args...)` byte sequence and part of the `ArgsDescriptor` (see below).

- The producer **MUST** set `ciphertext` to the encryption of exactly

  ```solidity
  abi.encode(argsDescriptor)
  ```

  under the key identified by `publicKeyId`, where `argsDescriptor` is an `ArgsDescriptor` as defined below.

- The producer **MUST** set `argsHash` to the value computed above.

A *call decryption oracle* implementation **MAY** provide a command line tool or endpoint
to generate `EncryptedHashedArguments` from plaintext arguments.

This ERC does not standardize the encryption algorithm or key management; those are implementation-specific (similar to [ERC-7573](../EIPS/eip-7573.html)). Implementations **SHOULD** document how `publicKeyId` is derived from the underlying key material.

#### Argument Descriptor structure (normative for eligibility)

Prior to encryption, the arguments are bundled with an (optional) list of `eligibleCaller`s, to allow a
*Call Decryption Oracle* to enforce eligibility of the requester in a consistent way. This prevents decryption
by other contracts through observing encrypted arguments and requesting a call to the call decryption oracle.

This ERC standardizes the layout of the decrypted payload as:

```solidity
struct ArgsDescriptor {
    /**
     * List of addresses allowed to request decryption.
     * If empty, any requester is allowed. This is enforced off-chain by the oracle operator.
     */
    address[] eligibleCaller;

    /**
     * Plain argument payload, may be abi.encode(args...).
     */
    bytes argsPlain;
}
```

In this case, producers set

```solidity
bytes32 argsHash = keccak256(argsDescriptor.argsPlain);
bytes   ciphertext = ENC_publicKeyId(abi.encode(argsDescriptor));
```

The `eligibleCaller` list is not visible to on-chain contracts; it is only used off-chain by the
oracle operator to decide whether to honor a decryption request.

### 2. Call descriptor

A **call descriptor** defines:

- which contract and function will be called, and
- any validity constraint (e.g. expiry block).

```solidity
struct CallDescriptor {
    /**
     * Contract that will be called by the oracle.
     */
    address targetContract;

    /**
     * Function that will be called by the oracle.
     * 4-byte function selector for the targetContract whose signature MUST be (uint256, bytes).
     */
    bytes4 selector;

    /**
     * Optional expiry (block number). 0 means "no explicit expiry".
     */
    uint256 validUntilBlock;
}
```

#### Plain vs. Encrypted Call Descriptors

A call descriptor can be:

- **Plain**: `CallDescriptor` is passed in clear on-chain.
- **Encrypted**: `CallDescriptor` is wrapped into:

```solidity
struct EncryptedCallDescriptor {
    /**
     * Identifier of the public key used for encryption.
     */
    bytes32 publicKeyId;

    /**
     * Ciphertext of abi.encode(CallDescriptor), encrypted under publicKeyId.
     */
    bytes ciphertext;
}
```

#### Normative requirements (CallDescriptor and EncryptedCallDescriptor)

- When using `EncryptedCallDescriptor`, the ciphertext **MUST** be the encryption
  of exactly `abi.encode(CallDescriptor)` under the key identified by `publicKeyId`.

### 3. Encryption/Decryption Method and optional Second Factor

The encryption/decryption method is an implementation detail of the call decryption oracle contract
and bound to the contract address. Different instances may utilize different methods.
The publicKeyId can serve as an indication in case the oracle performs a key rotation.

#### Second Factor

The oracle interface to request a call with encrypted arguments allows passing an optional `secondFactor`.
The interpretation and encoding of the second factor is an implementation detail of a concrete oracle
implementation.

The second factor enables decryption schemes in which the owner/operator of the decryption oracle
**cannot** decrypt the encrypted arguments before a request is made that provides this factor. This is
useful in use-cases such as order books, where the oracle operator should not be able to inspect orders
before a reveal / decryption phase. In such setups, trust in the oracle is primarily about **timely
fulfilment**, not about keeping arguments secret forever.

The passed second factor may be an `abi.encode(...)` of a more complex structure, e.g. an encoded
`bytes[]`, thus allowing for multiple factors to implement a k-out-of-n threshold decryption off-chain.

### 4. Oracle interface

The oracle exposes a **request/fulfill** pattern. Requests are cheap and do not require on-chain decryption;
fulfillment is called by an off-chain operator after decryption.

```solidity
interface ICallDecryptionOracle {
    /// Raised when a request with plain call descriptor + encrypted args is registered.
    event CallRequested(
        uint256 indexed requestId,
        address indexed requester,
        address   targetContract,
        bytes4    selector,
        uint256   validUntilBlock,
        bytes32   argsPublicKeyId,
        bytes     argsCiphertext,
        bytes32   argsHash,
        bytes     secondFactor
    );

    /// Raised when a request with encrypted call descriptor + encrypted args is registered.
    event EncryptedCallRequested(
        uint256 indexed requestId,
        address indexed requester,
        bytes32 callPublicKeyId,
        bytes   callCiphertext,
        bytes32 argsPublicKeyId,
        bytes   argsCiphertext,
        bytes32   argsHash,
        bytes     secondFactor
    );

    /// Raised when an execution attempt has been fulfilled by the oracle operator.
    event CallFulfilled(
        uint256 indexed requestId,
        bool    success,
        bytes   returnData
    );

    enum RejectionReason {
        // "unspecified/other" for forward-compatibility
        Unspecified,
        RequestNotFound,
        Expired,
        ArgsHashMismatch,
        CallerNotEligible,
        OperatorPolicy,
        TargetCallFailed
    }

    /// @notice Emitted when a call has been rejected.
    event CallRejected(
        uint256 indexed requestId,
        RejectionReason reason,
        bytes   details  // optional extra info, may be empty
    );

    /**

### 5. Target contract

A common pattern is that the target contract

1. In an initialization phase, receives and stores an encrypted argument `encArg` together with its hash `argsHash`,
   where `argsHash` is the hash of the plaintext argument payload.
2. In the execution phase, the caller issues a request to the call decryption oracle, obtains the
   `requestId` returned by `requestCall` / `requestEncryptedCall`, and passes this `requestId`
   along with `argsHash` to the call target (may be the same contract) in the same transaction.
   The call target then receives the decrypted argument payload `argsPlain` (under a callback selector)
   from the *call decryption oracle*, with the corresponding `requestId` and recomputes the hash and compares
   it to the stored value.
3. The call target can the procees with the business logic operating on the decrypted (and verified) arguments.

For example, the producer of `EncryptedHashedArguments` may choose

```solidity
bytes memory argsPlain = abi.encode(amount, beneficiary);
bytes32 argsHash = keccak256(argsPlain);
```

The target (or router) contract can then do:

```solidity
mapping(uint256 => bytes32) public argsHashByRequestId;

function registerArguments(uint256 requestId, bytes32 argsHash) external {
// In the same transaction as the request, store the commitment for this requestId.
argsHashByRequestId[requestId] = argsHash;
}

/**
 * @dev Target selector: Called by the Call Decryption Oracle with decrypted arguments.
 * The oracle calls this function with signature
 *    callback(uint256 requestId, bytes argsPlain)
 * where requestId is the technical correlation id assigned by the oracle.
 */
function executeWithVerification(
uint256 requestId,
bytes   calldata argsPlain
) external {
// Lookup the pre-committed hash from the init phase.
bytes32 stored = argsHashByRequestId[requestId];
require(stored != bytes32(0), "Unknown requestId");

// Recompute the hash from the received bytes.
bytes32 computed = keccak256(argsPlain);
require(computed == stored, "Encrypted args mismatch");

/**
 * Optional: decode argsPlain to use it, e.g.
 *   (uint256 amount, address beneficiary) = abi.decode(argsPlain, (uint256, address));
 * and route to business logic.
 */
}
```

In this pattern:

- `argsHash` is the hash commit of `argsPlain` created upon off-chain argument construction.
- `requestId` is the technical identifier assigned by the Call Decryption Oracle when the request is issued.
  It is useful for correlation, logging and mapping inside routers, but is not required for the hash check.
- The `argsPlain` field passed to `fulfill*` is the exact byte payload used to compute `argsHash`. The callback
  (target or router) decodes `argsPlain` to recover the business arguments.
- A router/adapter contract can implement the `executeWithVerification(uint256 requestId, bytes argsPlain)` callback,
  perform the verification and decoding, and then call an already deployed target contract with its original typed
  function signature.

Implementations SHOULD register the `(requestId, argsHash)` mapping in the same transaction
that issues the request to the oracle, to avoid any race where a very fast oracle operator
could attempt to fulfill a request before the mapping is written on-chain. Even if the mapping
is missing, the callback pattern above will cause the fulfillment to revert (due to `Unknown requestId`);
however, registering in the same transaction provides deterministic behaviour.

## Rationale

- The **two-stage design** (arguments vs. call) allows encrypted arguments to be reusable and independent of any particular call descriptor.
- The explicit **hash commitment** (`argsHash`) binds arguments to a commitment stored by the receiving contract, while still allowing the arguments to be stored and passed separately as opaque bytes.
- The **request/fulfill pattern** reflects that decryption is off-chain. Requests are cheap; fulfill is initiated when decryption is ready.
- The use of `abi.encodeWithSelector(selector, requestId, argsPlain)` makes the on-chain oracle generic and able to support arbitrary function signatures while still providing a standard correlation identifier (`requestId`).
- **Router/adapter pattern:** when integrating with already deployed contracts whose function signatures cannot be changed, a small router contract can serve as the callback. The router implements a function like `executeWithVerification(uint256 requestId, bytes argsPlain)`, verifies `requestId` and `argsHash` as above, decodes `argsPlain` into typed arguments, and then calls the pre-existing target contract with its original typed function. This preserves compatibility with existing deployments while still using the standard *call decryption oracle*.

## Backwards Compatibility

This ERC is designed to coexist with [ERC-7573](../EIPS/eip-7573.html) decryption oracles. An existing [ERC-7573](../EIPS/eip-7573.html) implementation can be extended to implement `ICallDecryptionOracle` without breaking existing interfaces.

## Reference Implementation

A non-normative reference implementation (Solidity) and a matching Java/off-chain implementation are provided separately. They illustrate:

- storage of pending requests,
- event emission for both encrypted and plain call descriptors,
- validation of hash bindings, and
- low-level call execution.

These implementations are work-in-progress and may evolve independently of the ERC text.

### Fees

Implementations MAY charge fees in ETH or [ERC-20](../EIPS/eip-20.html) tokens as part of their specific deployment.

## Security Considerations

### Oracle trust

The on-chain contract cannot verify correctness of decryption; it can only check that `keccak256(argsPlain) == argsHash`.
Parties must trust the oracle operator (or design an incentive/penalty mechanism) to decrypt correctly and call `fulfill*`
faithfully.

### Replay

Implementations SHOULD mitigate replay by:

- using `validUntilBlock` in `CallDescriptor`, and/or
- including nonces or sequence numbers in higher-level protocols.

### Access control

Access control is an application-level concern. A common pattern is to embed an access-control list such as
`address[] eligibleCaller` inside the encrypted payload (in `ArgsDescriptor`) and have the off-chain oracle
operator enforce that the original requester is contained in that list (unless the list is empty, meaning
"any requester"). The standard does not prescribe a particular access-control mechanism beyond this guidance.

### Traceability and non-mixing

This ERC is **not** intended to act as a mixer or general-purpose anonymization service for payments or calls.
Its purpose is to **defer** the disclosure of arguments (and optionally the call descriptor) until fulfillment.

Implementations SHOULD preserve the ability for off-chain indexers and observers to correlate
`CallFulfilled` events with the corresponding `CallRequested` / `EncryptedCallRequested` events,
for example by strictly adhering to the `requestId` linkage defined in this ERC.

Once a request is fulfilled, an observer can always reconstruct which `requester` initiated the request
and which call and arguments were eventually used. Protocols that deliberately try to break this
correlation or to hide value flows are out of scope of this ERC.
