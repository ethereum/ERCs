## Abstract
In this standard, a non-fungible token stands as atomic existence and encourages
layers of abstraction built on top of it. Ideal for representing concepts like
rights, a form of abstract ownership. Such right can take the form of NFT options,
oracle membership, virtual coupons, etc., and can then be made liquid because of
this tokenization.

## Motivation
Non-fungible tokens are popularized by the [ERC-721](./eip-721.md) NFT standard
for representing "ownership over digital or physical assets". Over the course of
development, reputable NFT projects are about crypto-assets, digital collectibles,
etc. The proposed standard aims to single out a special type of NFTs that are
ideal for representing abstract ownership such as rights. Examples include the
right of making a function call to a smart contract, an NFT option that gives
the owner the right, but not obligation, to purchase an ERC-721 NFT, and the prepaid
membership (time-dependent right) of accessing to data feeds provided by oracles
without having to pay the required token fees. An on-chain subscription business
model can then be made available by this standard. The conceptual clarity of an
NFT is hence improved by this standard.

## Specification
```
interface IERC3754 {
    event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 indexed tokenId);
    event Approval(address indexed owner, address indexed approved, uint256 indexed tokenId);
    event ApprovalForAll(address indexed owner, address indexed operator, bool approved);

    function balanceOf(address owner) external view returns (uint256);
    function ownerOf(uint256 tokenId) external view returns (address);
    function approve(address to, uint256 tokenId) external;
    function getApproved(uint256 tokenId) external view returns (address);
    function setApprovalForAll(address operator, bool approved) external;
    function isApprovedForAll(address owner, address operator) external view returns (bool);
    function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId) external;
    function safeTransferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId) external;
    function safeTransferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId, bytes memory _data) external;
}
```

## Rationale
The NFTs defined in the [ERC-721](./eip-721.md) standard are already largely
accepted and known as representing ownership of digital assets, and the NFTs by
this standard aim to be accepted and known as representing abstract ownership.
This is achieved by allowing and encouraging layers of abstract utilities built
on top of them. Ownership of such NFTs is equivalent with having the rights to
perform functions assigned to such tokens. Transfer of such rights is also made
easier because of this tokenization. To further distinguish this standard
from [ERC-721](./eip-721.md), data fields and functions related to `URI` are
excluded.

## Backwards Compatibility
There is no further backwards compatibility required.

## Security Considerations
The security is enhanced from ERC721, given tokens are minted without having to
provide `URI`s. Errors in dealing with `URI`s can be avoided.
