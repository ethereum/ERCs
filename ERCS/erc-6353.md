## Abstract

An extension to [EIP-20](./eip-20.md) that can automatically send an additional percentage of each transfer to a third party, and that provides an interface for retrieving this information. This can allow token owners to make donations to a charity with every transfer. This can also be used to allow automated savings programs.

## Motivation

There are charity organizations with addresses on-chain, and there are token holders who want to make automated donations. Having a standardized way of collecting and managing these donations helps users and user interface developers. Users can make an impact with their token and can contribute to achieving sustainable blockchain development. Projects can easily retrieve charity donations addresses and rate for a given [EIP-20](./eip-20.md) token, token holders can compare minimum rate donation offers allowed by token contract owners. This standard provides functionality that allows token holders to donate easily.

## Specification

The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

Owner of the contract **MAY**, after review, register charity address in `whitelistedRate` and set globally a default rate of donation. To register the address, the rate **MUST** not be null.

Token holders **MAY** choose and specify a default charity address from `_defaultAddress`, this address **SHOULD** be different from the null address for the donation to be activated.

The donation is a percentage-based rate model, but the calculation can be done differently. Applications and individuals can implement this standard by retrieving information with `charityInfo()` , which specifies an assigned rate for a given address.

This standard provides functionality that allows token holders to donate easily. The donation when activated is done directly in the overridden `transfer`, `transferFrom`, and `approve` functions.

When `transfer`, `transferFrom` are called the sender's balance is reduced by the initial amount and a donation amount is deduced. The initial transferred amount is transferred to the recipient's balance and an additional donation amount is transferred to a third party (charity). The two transfer are done at the same time and emit two `Transfer` events.
Also, if the account has an insufficient balance to cover the transfer and the donation the whole transfer would revert.

## Rationale

 This EIP chooses to whitelist charity addresses by using an array and keeping track of the "active" status with a mapping `whitelistedRate` to allow multiple choice of recipient and for transparence. The donation address can also be a single address chosen by the owner of the contract and modified by period.

 If the sender balance is insuficent i.e total amount of token (initial transfer + donation) is insuficent the transfer would revert. Donation are done in the `transfer` function to simplify the usage and to not add an additional function, but the implementation could be donne differently, and for example allow a transfer to go through without the donation amount when donation is activated. The token implementer can also choose to store the donation in the contract or in another one and add a withdrawal or claimable function, so the charity can claim the allocated amount of token themselves, the additional transfer will be triggered by the charity and not the token holder.

 Also, donations amount are calculated here as a percentage of the amount of token transferred to allow different case scenario, but the token implementer can decide to opt for another approach instead like rounding up the transaction value.

## Backwards Compatibility

This implementation is an extension of the functionality of [EIP-20](./eip-20.md), it introduces new functionality retaining the core interfaces and functionality of the [EIP-20](./eip-20.md) standard. There is a small backwards compatibility issue, indeed if an account has insufficient balance, it's possible for the transfer to fail.

## Test Cases

Tests can be found in [`charity.js`](../assets/eip-6353/test/charity.js).

## Reference Implementation

The reference implementation of the standard can be found under [`contracts/`](../assets/eip-6353/contracts/ERC20Charity.sol) folder.

## Security Considerations

There are no additional security considerations compared to EIP-20.
