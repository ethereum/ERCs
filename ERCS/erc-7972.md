## Abstract

This EIP introduces a `UniversalComplianceRouter` contract that acts as a universal compliance layer for RWA security tokens. It allows dynamic registration of compliance modules, each associated with a function selector. The router performs aggregated compliance checks by invoking these modules with user-specific parameters such as jurisdiction using staticcall method. This enables flexible, composable, and upgradable compliance enforcement across jurisdictions and asset classes.

## Motivation

On-chain compliance for tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) such as money market funds, real estate, private equity, and fixed-income securities etc. is becoming essential as adoption increases. Regulatory frameworks (KYC, AML, accredited investor rules, jurisdiction-specific rules) are often complex, evolving, and differ across asset classes and countries.

Currently, developers hardcode compliance logic into token contracts or wrap tokens with enforcement proxies. These approaches are:

- **Inflexible**: They require contract redeployments to update rules.
- **Siloed**: Each protocol creates and audits its own compliance logic.
- **Non-composable**: Tokens, marketplaces, and identity services cannot easily interoperate.

This results in duplicated effort, increased audit surface, and fragmentation across ecosystems.

We need a **shared, modular, and extensible compliance layer** that:

- Allows for dynamic updates to compliance rules
- Enables jurisdiction-specific enforcement logic
- Promotes reuse and composability across protocols
- Encourages collaboration between identity providers, compliance services, and token issuers

The `UniversalComplianceRouter` addresses these needs by serving as a pluggable registry and execution layer for compliance modules that can be applied across different asset types, jurisdictions, and lifecycle events.

## Specification

Note: The interface and implementation below can be extended to include KYC levels and other KYC/AML checks as parameters in the `isCompliant` function. The core idea is to allow the registration of compliance frameworks or sub-proxies within the Universal Compliance Router, each exposing a unified callable selector for a specific category of compliance contracts. The registered sub-router/proxy or compliance contract counts in the Universal Compliance Router should be optimized to reduce the computational cost associated with looping operations.

## Rationale

The `UniversalComplianceRouter` is designed with the following decisions:

- **Modular Contract Registration**: Compliance contracts are registered with their corresponding function selectors (`bytes4`) to allow for diverse validation logic without assuming fixed interfaces. This allows backwards-compatible upgrades and supports heterogeneous compliance frameworks.
- **Staticcall for Safety**: Compliance checks are invoked via `staticcall`, ensuring they are read-only and cannot modify state. This makes the router safe to integrate with other on-chain systems and supports off-chain simulation for auditability.
- **Dual Registry Design**: The router maintains separate lists for:

  - *General compliance contracts*: which apply globally,
  - *Jurisdiction-aware contracts*: which are checked conditionally based on the user’s jurisdiction (passed as a `bytes32` identifier).

  This split improves clarity and allows different enforcement strategies to coexist.
- **Iterative Check Model**: The router returns `true` on the *first passing check*. This conservative model optimizes for gas efficiency while enabling compliance layering.
- **Owner-controlled Registration**: To avoid misuse, only the deployer (or designated admin) can register or remove compliance modules. This can later be extended to role-based or DAO-based control models.

This architecture provides a **low-coupling**, **high-composability** mechanism for evolving compliance logic that can serve as shared infrastructure for the RWA ecosystem.
