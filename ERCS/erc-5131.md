## Abstract
This EIP links one or more signing wallets via Ethereum Name Service Specification ([EIP-137](./eip-137.md)) to prove control and asset ownership of a main wallet.

## Motivation
Proving ownership of an asset to a third party application in the Ethereum ecosystem is common. Users frequently sign payloads of data to authenticate themselves before gaining access to perform some operation. However, this method--akin to giving the third party root access to one's main wallet--is both insecure and inconvenient.

***Examples:***
 1. In order for you to edit your profile on OpenSea, you must sign a message with your wallet.
 2. In order to access NFT gated content, you must sign a message with the wallet containing the NFT in order to prove ownership.
 3. In order to gain access to an event, you must sign a message with the wallet containing a required NFT in order to prove ownership.
 4. In order to claim an airdrop, you must interact with the smart contract with the qualifying wallet.
 5. In order to prove ownership of an NFT, you must sign a payload with the wallet that owns that NFT.

In all the above examples, one interacts with the dApp or smart contract using the wallet itself, which may be
 - inconvenient (if it is controlled via a hardware wallet or a multi-sig)
 - insecure (since the above operations are read-only, but you are signing/interacting via a wallet that has write access)

Instead, one should be able to approve multiple wallets to authenticate on behalf of a given wallet.

### Problems with existing methods and solutions
Unfortunately, we've seen many cases where users have accidentally signed a malicious payload. The result is almost always a significant loss of assets associated with the signing address.

In addition to this, many users keep significant portions of their assets in 'cold storage'. With the increased security from 'cold storage' solutions, we usually see decreased accessibility because users naturally increase the barriers required to access these wallets.

Some solutions propose dedicated registry smart contracts to create this link, or new protocols to be supported. This is problematic from an adoption standpoint, and there have not been any standards created for them. 

### Proposal: Use the Ethereum Name Service (EIP-137)
Rather than 're-invent the wheel', this proposal aims to use the widely adopted Ethereum Name Service in conjunction with the ENS Text Records feature ([EIP-634](./eip-634.md)) in order to achieve a safer and more convenient way to sign and authenticate, and provide 'read only' access to a main wallet via one or more secondary wallets.

From there, the benefits are twofold. This EIP gives users increased security via outsourcing potentially malicious signing operations to wallets that are more accessible (hot wallets), while being able to maintain the intended security assumptions of wallets that are not frequently used for signing operations.

#### Improving dApp Interaction Security
Many dApps requires one to prove control of a wallet to gain access. At the moment, this means that you must interact with the dApp using the wallet itself. This is a security issue, as malicious dApps or phishing sites can lead to the assets of the wallet being compromised by having them sign malicious payloads.

However, this risk would be mitigated if one were to use a secondary wallet for these interactions. Malicious interactions would be isolated to the assets held in the secondary wallet, which can be set up to contain little to nothing of value.

#### Improving Multiple Device Access Security
In order for a non-hardware wallet to be used on multiple devices, you must import the seed phrase to each device. Each time a seed phrase is entered on a new device, the risk of the wallet being compromised increases as you are increasing the surface area of devices that have knowledge of the seed phrase.

Instead, each device can have its own unique wallet that is an authorized secondary wallet of the main wallet. If a device specific wallet was ever compromised or lost, you could simply remove the authorization to authenticate.

Further, wallet authentication can be chained so that a secondary wallet could itself authorize one or many tertiary wallets, which then have signing rights for both the secondary address as well as the root main address. This, can allow teams to each have their own signer while the main wallet can easily invalidate an entire tree, just by revoking rights from the root stem.

#### Improving Convenience
Many invididuals use hardware wallets for maximum security. However, this is often inconvenient, since many do not want to carry their hardware wallet with them at all times.

Instead, if you approve a non-hardware wallet for authentication activities (such as a mobile device), you would be able to use most dApps without the need to have your hardware wallet on hand.

## Specification
The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”, “SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

Let:
 - `mainAddress` represent the wallet address we are trying to authenticate or prove asset ownership for.
 - `mainENS` represent the reverse lookup ENS string for `mainAddress`.
 - `authAddress` represent the address we want to use for signing in lieu of `mainAddress`.
 - `authENS` represent the reverse lookup ENS string for `authAddress`.
 - `authKey` represents a string in the format `[0-9A-Za-z]+`.

Control of `mainAddress` and ownership of `mainAddress` assets by `authAddress` is proven if all the following conditions are met:
 - `mainAddress` has an ENS resolver record and a reverse record set to `mainENS`.
 - `authAddress` has an ENS resolver record and a reverse record set to `authENS`.
 - `authENS` has an ENS TEXT record `eip5131:vault` in the format `<authKey>:<mainAddress>`.
 - `mainENS` has an ENS TEXT record `eip5131:<authKey>`.

### Setting up one or many `authAddress` records on a single ENS domain
The `mainAddress` MUST have an ENS resolver record and reverse record configured.
In order to automatically discover the linked account, the `authAddress` SHOULD have an ENS resolver record and reverse record configured.

1. Choose an unused `<authKey>`. This can be any string in the format `[0-0A-Za-z]+`.
2. Set a TEXT record `eip5131:<authKey>` on `mainENS`, with the value set to the desired `authAddress`.
3. Set a TEXT record `eip5131:vault` on `authENS`, with the value set to the `<authKey>:mainAddress`.

Currently this EIP does not enforce an upper-bound on the number of `authAddress` entries you can include. Users can repeat this process with as many address as they like.

### Authenticating `mainAddress` via `authAddress`
Control of `mainAddress` and ownership of `mainAddress` assets is proven if any associated `authAddress` is the `msg.sender` or has signed the message.

Practically, this would work by performing the following operations:
1. Get the resolver for `authENS`
2. Get the `eip5131:vault` TEXT record of `authENS`
3. Parse `<authKey>:<mainAddress>` to determine the `authKey` and `mainAddress`.
4. MUST get the reverse ENS record for `mainAddress` and verify that it matches `<mainENS>`.
    - Otherwise one could set up other ENS nodes (with auths) that point to `mainAddress` and authenticate via those.
5. Get the `eip5131:<authKey>` TEXT record of `mainENS` and ensure it matches `authAddress`.

Note that this specification allows for both contract level and client/server side validation of signatures.  It is not limited to smart contracts, which is why there is no proposed external interface definition.

### Revocation of `authAddress`
To revoke permission of `authAddress`, delete the `eip5131:<authKey>` TEXT record of `mainENS` or update it to point to a new `authAddress`.

## Rationale

### Usage of EIP-137
The proposed specification makes use of EIP-137 rather than introduce another registry paradigm. The reason for this is due to the existing wide adoption of EIP-137 and ENS.

However, the drawback to EIP-137 is that any linked `authAddress` must contain some ETH in order to set the `authENS` reverse record as well as the `eip5131:vault` TEXT record. This can be solved by a separate reverse lookup registry that enables `mainAddress` to set the reverse record and TEXT record with a message signed by `authAddress`.

With the advent of L2s and ENS Layer 2 functionalities, off chain verification of linked addresses is possible even with domains managed across different chains.

### One-to-Many Authentication Relationship
This proposed specification allows for a one (`mainAddress`) to many (`authAddress`) authentication relationship.  i.e. one `mainAddress` can authorize many `authAddress` to authenticate, but an `authAddress` can only authenticate itself or a single `mainAddress`.

The reason for this design choice is to allow for simplicity of authentication via client and smart contract code. You can determine which `mainAddress` the `authAddress` is signing for without any additional user input.

Further, you can design UX without any user interaction necessary to 'pick' the interacting address by display assets owned by `authAddress` and `mainAddress` and use the appropriate address dependent on the asset the user is attempting to authenticate with.

## Reference Implementation

### Client/Server Side
In typescript, the validation function, using ethers.js would be as follows:
```
export interface LinkedAddress {
  ens: string,
  address: string,
}

export async function getLinkedAddress(
  provider: ethers.providers.EnsProvider, address: string
): Promise<LinkedAddress | null> {
  const addressENS = await provider.lookupAddress(address);
  if (!addressENS) return null;

  const vaultInfo = await (await provider.getResolver(addressENS))?.getText('eip5131:vault');
  if (!vaultInfo) return null;

  const vaultInfoArray = vaultInfo.split(':');
  if (vaultInfoArray.length !== 2) {
    throw new Error('EIP5131: Authkey and vault address not configured correctly.');
  }

  const [ authKey, vaultAddress ] = vaultInfoArray;

  const vaultENS = await provider.lookupAddress(vaultAddress);
  if (!vaultENS) {
    throw new Error(`EIP5131: No ENS domain with reverse record set for vault.`);
  };

  const expectedSigningAddress = await (
    await provider.getResolver(vaultENS)
  )?.getText(`eip5131:${authKey}`);

  if (expectedSigningAddress?.toLowerCase() !== address.toLowerCase()) {
    throw new Error(`EIP5131: Authentication mismatch.`);
  };

  return {
    ens: vaultENS,
    address: vaultAddress
  };
}
```

### Contract side

#### With a backend
If your application operates a secure backend server, you could run the client/server code above, then use the result in conjunction with specs like [EIP-1271](./eip-1271.md) : `Standard Signature Validation Method for Contracts` for a cheap and secure way to validate that the message signer is indeed authenticated for the main address.

#### Without a backend (JavaScript only)
Provided is a reference implementation for an internal function to verify that the message sender has an authentication link to the main address.

## Security Considerations
The core purpose of this EIP is to enhance security and promote a safer way to authenticate wallet control and asset ownership when the main wallet is not needed and assets held by the main wallet do not need to be moved. Consider it a way to do 'read only' authentication.
