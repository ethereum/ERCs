## Abstract

A Purpose Bound Money (PBM) token is a wrapper around an [ERC-1155](./eip-1155.md) token that can be used for a limited activity. This proposal outlines a smart contract interface that builds upon the ERC-1155 standard to implement the purpose bound money (PBM) concept:

- A PBM consists of a PBM wrapper and the digital money token it wraps. A digital money token (e.g., stablecoins, central bank digital currencies, tokenized bank deposits, and similar instruments) serves as a store of value (abbreviated as "sov"). Thus, a digital money token (also referred to as "sovToken") **SHOULD** be:
  - a good store of value;
  - a suitable unit of account; and
  - a medium of exchange.
- PBMs are bearer instruments, with self-contained programming logic, and can be transferred between two parties without involving intermediaries. It combines the concept of:
  - programmable payment - automatic execution of payments once a pre-defined set of conditions are met; and
  - programmable money - the possibility of embedding rules within the medium of exchange itself that define or constrain its usage.
- Once the conditions are met, sovToken is released, and it becomes unbounded once again. A PBM can be thought of as a digital cash voucher, because it places constraints on how a payer can use the PBM but does not impose any constraints on the merchant/redeemer because the PBM unwraps and releases the underlying digital money upon payment to the merchant/redeemer. This is akin to a physical cash voucher: the payer is restricted to purchases from the merchants specified by the issuer but the merchants accepting the vouchers can exchange the physical vouchers with the issuer for fiat money.

In this EIP, we propose a modular structure consisting of a sovToken compatible with [ERC-20](./eip-20.md) as the digital money, an ERC-1155 compatible smart contract as the PBM wrapper, a compliance guard smart contract as a component of the PBM Wrapper logic, and a PBM token manager smart contract to manage token registration and retrieval.

## Motivation

Purpose Bound Money (PBM) enables digital currencies to carry conditions on how they can be spent, making them especially useful in real-world scenarios such as:

- **Government vouchers** (e.g. CDC vouchers in Singapore), where funds should only be redeemable at approved heartland merchants;
- **Conditional disbursements**, such as SkillsFuture learning accounts, where funds are released only after course participation is verified;
- **Escrow-style payments**, like homebuyer milestones, where payouts to developers are tied to the completion of specific construction stages;

This proposal intends to forestall technology fragmentation and consequently a lack of interoperability. By making the PBM specification open, it gives new participants easy and free access to the pre-existing market standards, enabling interoperability across different platforms, wallets, payment systems and rails. This would lower cost of entry for new participants, foster a vibrant payment landscape and prevent the development of walled gardens and monopolies, ultimately leading to more efficient, affordable services and better user experiences.

## Specification

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.

### Definitions

- **sovToken** - an ERC-20 or ERC-20 compatible digital currency (e.g. [ERC-777](./eip-777.md), [ERC-1363](./eip-1363.md)) serving as the store of value token (i.e. collateral backing the PBM Token).

- **PBM Wrapper** - an ERC-1155 compliant smart contract, which wraps the sovToken by specifying one or more conditions that have to be met (referred to as PBM business logic in subsequent section of this proposal). The PBM wrapper can be designed to be modular in nature, with core, plug-ins and hooks components (see section on PBM Architecture for elaboration). The PBM wrapper smart contract, together with adopted hooks smart contracts verifies that condition(s) has/have been met before unwrapping the underlying sovToken.

- **PBM Token** - the sovToken and its PBM wrapper are collectively referred to as a PBM Token. PBM Tokens are represented as ERC-1155 tokens.

- **PBM Creator** defines the conditions of the PBM Wrapper to create PBM Tokens.

- **Merchant / Redeemer** - In the context of this proposal, a Merchant or a Redeemer is broadly defined as the ultimate recipient, or endpoint, for PBM tokens, to which these tokens are intrinsically directed or purpose-bound to. The identity of merchant/redeemer will be one of the validations performed by the compliance guard, which may be implemented as part of the PBM Wrapper smart contract or as a standalone compliance guard contract registered as a PBM hook.

### Overview

- PBM **SHALL** adhere to the definition of "wrap" or "wrapping" to mean binding a token in accordance with PBM business logic throughout its lifecycle.

- PBM **SHALL** adhere to the definition of "unwrap" or "unwrapping" to mean the release of a token in accordance with the PBM business logic during its lifecycle stage.

- A valid PBM Token **MUST** consist of an underlying sovToken and a PBM Wrapper.

  - The sovToken can be wrapped either upon the creation of the PBM Token or at a later date.

  - A sovToken can be implemented as any widely accepted ERC-20 compatible token, such as ERC-20, ERC-777, or ERC-1363.

- PBM Wrapper **MUST** provide a mechanism for all transacting parties to verify that all necessary condition(s) have been met before allowing the PBM Token to be unwrapped. Refer to Auditability section for elaborations. The necessary conditions can be implemented within the PBM wrapper, or in a separate PBM hook(s) smart contract(s).

- PBM Wrapper **MUST** ensure the destination address for unwrapped sovToken is in a whitelist of Merchant/Redeemer addresses and not in a blacklist of banned addresses prior to unwrapping the underlying sovToken.

- The PBM Token **MUST** be burnt upon being fully unwrapped and used.

- A PBM Token **SHOULD** have an expiry time that is decided by the PBM Creator.

  - For cases where an expiry time is not needed, the expiry time **SHOULD** be set to infinity (typically represented as the maximum value of uint256 or type(uint256).max).

- This proposal defines a base specification of what a PBM should entail. Extensions to this base specification can be implemented as separate specifications.

### PBM Architecture

In this EIP, we propose a modular PBM architecture that has three distinct components (the core, the plugins and the hooks):

- The **core components** contains basic functionalities and validation checks that all PBMs should have. Core components includes sovToken and PBM wrapper containing the core logic (e.g. logic to whitelist the merchant/redeemer address, logic to unwrap upon transfer to a whitelisted address, logic for minting and burning the PBM) and a token manager which allows for token registration, retrieval. In addition, the PBM wrapper **MAY** include logic to interface with plugins and hooks.
- The **plugin components** implement additional functionality that only specific PBMs may require (e.g. logic to call external application programming interfaces to verify specific PBM condition was met, logic to track PBM usage patterns).
- The **hook components** implement additional validation checks that some PBMs may need (e.g. checks for expiration, daily spending limit, goods & services limit etc).

For example, a PBM creator may want to ensure that only 50% of PBM Series A can be spent in supermarkets, while there are no restrictions on the proportion of PBM Series B that can be spent in supermarkets. The creator can implement a plugin smart contract to keep track of supermarket spending by PBM users and a hook to validate that less than 50% of the PBM Series A issued to a user is spent in a supermarket. This approach allows the same generic PBM wrapper and sovToken to be used for both PBM Series A and B. In addition, PBM Series A will register the plugin module and hook module for additional data tracking and validations.

### Auditability

PBM Wrapper **SHOULD** provide the public easily accessible mechanism(s) to verify the smart contract logic for unwrapping a PBM. Such mechanisms could be leveraged by automated validation or asynchronous user verifications from transacting parties and/or whitelisted third parties attestations.

As the fulfilment of PBM conditions is likely to be subjected to audits to ensure trust amongst all transacting parties, the following evidence shall be documented to support audits:

- The interface/events emitted **SHOULD** allow a fine-grained recreation of the transaction history, token types and token balances
- The source code **SHOULD** be verified and formally published on a blockchain explorer.

### Fungibility

A PBM Wrapper **SHOULD** be able to wrap multiple types of compatible sovTokens (e.g. the same PBM Wrapper should be able to wrap USDC and XSGD). sovTokens wrapped by the same PBM wrapper may or may not be fungible to one another. The standard does NOT mandate how an implementation must do this.

### PBM token details

The ERC-1155 Multi Token Standard enables each token ID to correspond to a unique, configurable token type. All essential details facilitating the business or display logic for a PBM **MUST** be defined for each token type. The mandatory fields for this purpose are outlined in the `struct PBMToken` (below). Future proposals may define additional, optional state variables as needed. Once a token detail has been defined, it **MUST** be immutable.

Example of token details:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

interface IPBMRC1_TokenManager {
    /// @notice A PBM token MUST include compulsory state variables (name, faceValue, expiry, and uri) to adhere to this standard.
    /// @dev Represents all the details corresponding to a PBM tokenId.
    struct PBMToken {
        // Name of the token.
        string name;

        // Value of the underlying wrapped ERC20-compatible sovToken. Additional information on the `faceValue` can be specified by
        // adding the optional variables: `currencySymbol` or `tokenSymbol` as indicated below
        uint256 faceValue;

        // Time after which the token will be rendered useless (expressed in Unix Epoch time).
        uint256 expiry;

        // Metadata URI for ERC-1155 display purposes.
        string uri;
    }
}
```

An implementer of the standard can enhance their PBM tokens with additional functionality by implementing the `IPBMRC1_TokenManagerExt` interface. This extension provides optional properties that can be used to support a variety of use cases beyond the core requirements.

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

interface IPBMRC1_TokenManagerExt {
    /// @notice Optional properties that a PBM token MAY include for extended functionality.
    /// @dev Represents additional optional fields that can be implemented for a PBM tokenId.
    struct PBMTokenExt {
        // Indicates if the PBM token can be transferred to a non merchant/redeemer wallet.
        bool isTransferable;

        // Determines whether the PBM will be burned or revoked upon expiry, under certain predefined conditions, or at the owner's discretion.
        bool burnable;

        // Number of decimal places for the token.
        uint8 decimals;

        // The address of the creator of this PBM type on this smart contract. This field is optional because the creator is msg.sender by default.
        address creator;

        // The smart contract address of the sovToken.
        address tokenAddress;

        // The running balance of the PBM Token type that has been minted.
        uint256 totalSupply;

        // An ISO4217 three-character alphabetic code may be needed for the faceValue in multicurrency PBM use cases.
        string currencySymbol;

        // An abbreviation for the PBM token name may be assigned.
        string tokenSymbol;

        // Add other optional state variables below...
    }
}
```

An implementer has the option to define all token types upon PBM contract deployment. If needed, they can also expose an external function to create new PBM tokens at a later time.
All token types created **SHOULD** emit a `NewPBMTypeCreated` event.

```solidity
    /// @notice Creates a new PBM Token type with the provided data.
    /// @dev The caller of createPBMTokenType shall be responsible for setting the creator address.
    /// Example of uri can be found in [`sample-uri`](../assets/eip-7291/sample-uri/stx-10-static)
    /// MUST Emit the {NewPBMTypeCreated} event
    /// @param _name Name of the token.
    /// @param _faceValue Value of the underlying wrapped ERC20-compatible sovToken.
    /// @param _tokenExpiry Time after which the token will be rendered useless (expressed in Unix Epoch time).
    /// @param _tokenURI Metadata URI for ERC-1155 display purposes
    function createPBMTokenType(
        string memory _name,
        uint256 _faceValue,
        uint256 _tokenExpiry,
        string memory _tokenURI
    ) external returns (uint256 tokenId_);

    /// @notice Emitted when a new Purpose-Bound Token (PBM) type is created within the contract.
    /// @param tokenId The unique identifier for the newly created PBM token type.
    /// @param tokenName A human-readable string representing the name of the newly created PBM token type.
    /// @param amount The initial supply of the newly created PBM token type.
    /// @param expiry The timestamp at which the newly created PBM token type will expire.
    /// @param creator The address of the account that created the new PBM token type.
    event NewPBMTypeCreated(uint256 tokenId, string tokenName, uint256 amount, uint256 expiry, address creator);

```

Implementors of the standard **MUST** define a method to retrieve a PBM token detail

```solidity
    /// @notice Retrieves the details of a PBM Token type given its tokenId.
    /// @dev This function fetches the PBMToken struct associated with the tokenId and returns it.
    /// @param tokenId The identifier of the PBM token type.
    /// @return pbmToken_ A PBMToken struct containing all the details of the specified PBM token type.
    function getTokenDetails(uint256 tokenId) external view returns(PBMToken memory pbmToken_);
```

### Compliance Guard

A compliance guard should have logic to store and retrieve whitelisted merchants/redeemers and blacklisted addresses to fulfill the basic premise of a PBM. Additional logic can be added to fulfill other compliance goals.

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

/// @title Compliance Guard Interface.
/// @notice The compliance guard stores and manages whitelisted merchants/redeemers and blacklisted addresses for the PBMs
interface IComplianceGuard {
    /// @notice Checks if the address is one of the blacklisted addresses
    /// @param _address The address to query
    /// @return bool_ True if address is blacklisted, else false
    function isBlacklisted(address _address) external returns (bool bool_) ;

    /// @notice Checks if the address is one of the whitelisted merchant/redeemer addresses
    /// @param _address The address to query
    /// @return bool_ True if the address is in merchant/redeemer whitelist and is NOT a blacklisted address, otherwise false.
    function isMerchant(address _address) external returns (bool bool_) ;

    /// @notice Event emitted when the Merchant/Redeemer List is edited
    /// @param action Tags "add" or "remove" for action type
    /// @param addresses An array of merchant wallet addresses that was just added or removed from Merchant/Redeemer whitelist
    /// @param metadata Optional comments or notes about the added or removed addresses.
    event MerchantList(string action, address[] addresses, string metadata);

    /// @notice Event emitted when the Blacklist is edited
    /// @param action Tags "add" or "remove" for action type
    /// @param addresses An array of wallet addresses that was just added or removed from address blacklist
    /// @param metadata Optional comments or notes about the added or removed addresses.
    event Blacklist(string action, address[] addresses, string metadata);
}

```

### PBMRC1 - Base Interface

This interface contains the essential functions required to implement a pre-loaded PBM.

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

/// LIST OF EVENTS TO BE EMITTED
/// A database or explorer may listen to events and be able to provide indexed and categorized searches
/// @title PBM Specification interface
/// @notice The PBM (purpose bound money) allows us to add logical requirements on the use of sovTokens.
/// The PBM acts as wrapper around the sovTokens and implements the necessary business logic.
/// @dev PBM deployer must assign an overall owner to the smart contract. If fine grain access controls are required, EIP-5982 can be used on top of ERC173

    /// @notice Initialise the contract by specifying an underlying ERC20-compatible token address,

    /// @param _sovToken The address of the underlying sovToken.
    /// @param _expiry The contract-wide expiry timestamp (in Unix epoch time).
    /// @param _pbmWrapperLogic This address should point to a smart contract that contains conditions governing a PBM;

    /// The URI is not expected to be immutable.
    /// @param tokenId The id for the PBM in query

        This function transfers the underlying token from the caller into the PBM smart contract.
        IMPT: Before minting, the caller should approve the contract address to spend sovTokens on behalf of the caller.
            This can be done by calling the `approve` or `increaseMinterAllowance` functions of the ERC-20 contract and specifying `_spender` to be the PBM contract address.
            Ref : https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20

        WARNING: Any contracts that externally call these safeMint() and safeMintBatch() functions should implement some sort of reentrancy guard procedure
        (such as OpenZeppelin's ReentrancyGuard) or a Checks-effects-interactions pattern.

        As per ERC-5679 standard: When the token is being minted, the transfer events MUST be emitted as if the token in the `amount` for EIP-1155
        and `tokenId` being _id for EIP-1155 were transferred from address 0x0 to the recipient address identified by receiver.
        The total supply MUST increase accordingly.

        MUST Emit the {TokenWrap} event as the underlying sovToken is wrapped by the PBM wrapper smart contract during minting.

        Requirements:
        - contract must not be paused
        - tokens must not be expired
        - `tokenId` should be a valid id that has already been created

### Extensions

#### PBMRC1 - Token Receiver

Smart contracts MUST implement all of the functions in the PBMRC1_TokenReceiver interface to subscribe to PBM unwrap callbacks.

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

/// @notice Smart contracts MUST implement the ERC-165 `supportsInterface` function and signify support for the `PBMRC1_TokenReceiver` interface to accept callbacks.

interface PBMRC1_TokenReceiver {
    /**
        @notice Handles the callback from a PBM smart contract upon unwrapping
        @dev An PBM smart contract MUST call this function on the token recipient contract, at the end of a `unwrap` if the

#### PBMRC2 - Non preloaded PBM Interface

The **Non Preloaded** PBM extension is OPTIONAL for compliant smart contracts. This allows contracts to bind an underlying sovToken to the PBM at a later date instead of during a minting process.

Compliant contract **MUST** implement the following interface:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

/**
 *  @dev This interface extends IPBMRC1, adding functions for working with non-preloaded PBMs.
 *  Non-preloaded PBMs are minted as empty containers without any underlying tokens of value,
 *  allowing the loading of the underlying token to happen at a later stage.
 */
interface PBMRC2_NonPreloadedPBM is IPBMRC1 {

  /// @notice This function extends IPBMRC1 to mint PBM tokens as empty containers without underlying tokens of value.
  /// @dev The loading of the underlying token of value can be done by calling the `load` function. The function parameters should be identical to IPBMRC1
  function safeMint(address receiver, uint256 tokenId, uint256 amount, bytes calldata data) external;

  /// @notice This function extends IPBMRC1 to mint PBM tokens as empty containers without underlying tokens of value.
  /// @dev The loading of the underlying token of value can be done by calling the `load` function. The function parameters should be identical to IPBMRC1
  function safeMintBatch(address to, uint256[] calldata ids, uint256[] calldata amounts, bytes calldata data) external;

  /// @notice Wrap an amount of sovTokens into the PBM
  /// @dev function will pull sovTokens from msg.sender
  /// Approval must be given to the PBM smart contract in order to for the pbm to pull money from msg.sender
  /// underlying data structure must record how much the msg.sender has been loaded into the PBM.
  /// Emits {TokenLoad} event.
  /// @param amount    The amount of sovTokens to be loaded
  function load(uint256 amount) external;

  /// @notice Retrieves the balance of the underlying sovToken associated with a specific PBM token type and user address.
  /// This function provides a way to check the amount of the underlying token that a user has loaded into a particular PBM token.
  /// @param user The address of the user whose underlying token balance is being queried.
  /// @return The balance of the underlying sovToken associated with the specified PBM token type and user address.
  function underlyingBalanceOf(address user) external view returns (uint256);

  /// @notice Unloads all of the underlying token belonging to the caller from the PBM smart contract.
  /// @dev The underlying token that belongs to the caller (msg.sender) will be removed and transferred
  /// back to the caller.
  /// Emits {TokenUnload} event.
  /// @param amount The quantity of the corresponding tokens to be unloaded.
  /// Amount should not exceed the amount that the caller has originally loaded into the PBM smart contract.
  function unload(uint256 amount) external;

  /// @notice Emitted when an underlying token is loaded into a PBM
  /// @param caller Address by which sovToken is taken from.
  /// @param to Address by which the token is loaded and assigned to
  /// @param amount The quantity of tokens to be loaded
  /// @param sovToken The address of the underlying sovToken.
  /// @param sovTokenValue The amount of underlying sovTokens loaded
  event TokenLoad(address caller, address to, uint256 amount, address sovToken, uint256 sovTokenValue);

  /// @notice Emitted when an underlying token is unloaded from a PBM.
  /// This event indicates the process of releasing the underlying token from the PBM smart contract.
  /// @param caller The address initiating the token unloading process.
  /// @param from The address from which the token is being unloaded and removed from.
  /// @param amount The quantity of the corresponding unloaded tokens.
  /// @param sovToken The address of the underlying sovToken.
  /// @param sovTokenValue The amount of unloaded underlying sovTokens transferred.
  event TokenUnload(address caller, address from, uint256 amount, address sovToken, uint256 sovTokenValue);
}

```

## Rationale

### Why sovToken **MUST** be ERC-20 compatible?

As PBM is envisioned to have functionality of money, it has to be a fungible token with stable value. Currently, the major stablecoins in the market are mainly based on the ERC-20 interface. ERC-20 or ERC-20 compatible tokens are the most widely supported by existing wallets, defi apps, and used also by protocol design such as [ERC-4337](./eip-4337.md) and more importantly they are the de facto standard for fungible tokens.

With regards to [ERC-721](./eip-721.md) and ERC-1155 compatible tokens:

- ERC-721 is not suitable given that it is a standard for non-fungible tokens, which cannot fulfill the functions of money.
- While ERC-1155 tokens could be used for fungible tokens, we decided not to include it because there is a lack of ERC-1155 stablecoins in the market. Requiring the PBM interface to support both ERC-20 compatible and ERC-1155 compatible sovToken would complicate PBM interface without adding much practical utility. Furthermore, the base ERC-1155 does not support decimals, but this is not a dealbreaker as there can be workarounds. However, should there be changes in the stablecoin market in future, a revision can be considered.

### Why PBM Wrapper **MUST** be ERC-1155 compatible?

This paper extends the ERC-1155 standards in order to enable easy adoption by existing wallet providers. Currently, most wallet providers are able to support and display ERC-20, ERC-1155 and ERC-721 standards. An implementation which doesn't extend these standards will require the wallet provider to build a custom user interface and interfacing logic which increases the implementation cost and lengthen the time-to-market.

The core aim of our proposal is to standardize the implementation of PBM. Hence, we have surveyed existing interface standards and decided to build upon ERC-1155 standard for the PBM tokens for the following reasons:

- ERC-1155 allows a single contract to support multiple tokens. This is very useful for the PBM use cases as a single contract can support issuance of tokens with different denominations, expiry dates, business logics.
- ERC-1155 also has batch transfer support, which is absent in ERC-20, which could lead to gas savings when tokens have to be airdropped to a large number of recipients.
- ERC-1155 is able to support semi-fungible tokens which could be very useful for PBM use cases as a PBM can be converted into a collectible after its expiry.
- ERC-1155 allows for a visualisation of a PBM token on the UI of a wallet issuer.

### Why PBM **MUST** ensure the destination address for unwrapped sovToken is in a whitelist of Merchant/Redeemer addresses and not in a blacklist of banned addresses prior to unwrapping the underlying sovToken?

Why do we need a whitelist?

- The whitelist is a compulsory requirement because a PBM is purpose-bound, i.e., it should be unwrapped only if all conditions are fulfilled and it is transferred to someone in the predefined whitelist.
- In some implementations, developers can define a whitelisted address dynamically at runtime, such as requiring the presence of an NFT in a wallet address or relying on an oracle, etc.

Why do we need a blacklist?

- The blacklist is a compulsory requirement to ensure that accounts which were banned for various reasons (e.g., address owner has re-registered a new account, address owner suspended, withdrawn, or expelled due to complaints or law enforcement reasons, etc.) are excluded.

Why we can't have either a whitelist or a blacklist?

- While the same effect can be obtained by only having a whitelist, repeatedly redeploying the whitelist to the blockchain to ban one person is not gas efficient.
- Using only a blacklist to implement purpose-bound money is not practical as it would require maintaining a list of all addresses to be excluded and updating it whenever a new account is created.

Why is there a need for destination?

- This forms the core of our proposal: a PBM can be unwrapped when only it is transferred to pre-approved destinations.
- PBMs can be transferred freely, but only the target is allowed to unwrap the PBM and take delivery of the underlying sovToken must be limited to differentiate it from plain vanilla stablecoins that are wrapped by smart contracts.

### What does business logic encompass?

- In general, business logic can be categorized into core, plugin, and hook logic:
  - Core logic contains essential functionalities and validation checks and should be included in the PBM Wrapper contract.
  - Plugin and hook logic can be implemented as standalone smart contract modules and are registered by the PBM Wrapper contract. Plugin logic extends the core logic by adding functionality, e.g., custom data collection, additional administrative functions, etc.
  - Hook logic implements additional validation checks which are only applicable for a subset of PBMs.
- "PBM business logic" can contain access control logic, PBM unwrapping logic, API logic to integrate with non-blockchain IT systems.
- As PBM can be used for a wide variety of use cases, ranging from government disbursement tokens, shopping vouchers, prepaid tokens, rewards points tokens, purpose-bound donation tokens, school allowance tokens, etc., with each use case having separate business logic, it was intentionally left undefined so that implementation authors can have maximum flexibility.

### Why was a push transaction model chosen?

- This standard sticks to the push transaction model where the transfer of PBM is initiated on the sender's side. Modern wallets can support the required PBM logic by embedding the unwrapping logic within the ERC-1155 `safeTransfer` function.

### Customisability

Each ERC-1155 PBM Token would map to an underlying `PBMToken` data structure that implementers are free to customize in accordance to the business logic.

By mapping the underlying ERC-1155 token model with an additional data structure, implementers gain flexibility in the management of multiple token types within the same smart contract with multiple conditional unwrapping logic attached to each token type, reducing gas costs as there is no need to deploy multiple smart contracts for each token type.

1. To keep it simple, this standard _intentionally_ omits functions or events that doesn't add to definition and concept of a PBM.

2. This EIP makes no assumptions about access control or the conditions under which a function can be executed. It is the responsibility of the PBM creator to determine the various roles involved in each specific PBM business flow.

3. The proposed PBM Architecture _intentionally_ modular to enable greater customisability and reusability of smart contracts.

4. Metadata associated to the PBM standard is not included the standard. If necessary, related metadata can be created with a separate metadata extension interface, e.g. `ERC721Metadata` from ERC-721. Refer to Opensea's metadata-standards for an implementation example.

5. To allow for future extensibility, it is **RECOMMENDED** that developers read and adopt the specifications for building general extensibility for method behaviours ([ERC-5750](./eip-5750.md)).

## Backwards Compatibility

This interface is designed to be compatible with ERC-1155.

## Reference Implementation

Reference implementations can be found in [`README.md`](../assets/eip-7291/README.md).

## Security Considerations

- Malicious users may attempt to:

  - Double spend through reentrancy.
  - clone existing PBM Tokens to perform double-spending;
  - create invalid PBM Token with no underlying sovToken; or
  - falsifying the face value of PBM token through wrapping of fraudulent/invalid/worthless sovTokens.

- For consistency, when the contract is suspended or a user's token transfer is restricted due to suspected fraudulent activity or erroneous transfers, corresponding restrictions **MUST** be applied to the user's unwrap requests for the PBM Token.

- Security audits and tests should be performed to verify that unwrap logic behaves as expected or if any complex business logic is being implemented that involves calling an external smart contract to prevent re-entrancy attacks and other forms of call chain attacks.

- This EIP relies on the secure and accurate bookkeeping behavior of the token implementation.

  - Contracts adhering to this standard should closely monitor balance changes for each user during token consumption or minting.

  - The PBM Wrapper must be meticulously designed to ensure effective control over the permission to mint new tokens. Failure to secure the minting permission can lead to fraudulent issuance and unauthorized inflation of the total token supply.

  - The mapping of each PBM Token to the corresponding amount of underlying sovToken held by the smart contract requires careful accounting and auditing.

  - The access control over permission to burn tokens should be carefully designed. Typically, only the following two roles are entitled to burn a token:

    - Role 1. Prior to a PBM's expiry, only whitelisted merchants/redeemers with non-blacklisted wallet addresses are allowed to unwrap and burn tokens that they hold.
    - Role 2. After a PBM has expired:
      - whitelisted merchants/redeemers with non-blacklisted wallet addresses are allowed to unwrap and burn tokens that they hold; and
      - PBM owners are allowed to burn unused PBM Tokens remaining in the hands of non-whitelisted merchants/redeemers to retrieve underlying sovTokens.

  - Nevertheless, we do recognize there are potentially other use cases where a third type of role may be entitled to burning. Implementors should be cautious when designing access control over burning of PBM Tokens.

- It is recommended to adopt a sovToken standard that is compatible with ERC-20. Examples of such compatible tokens include those implementing ERC-777 or ERC-1363. However, ERC-20 remains the most widely accepted due to its simplicity and there is a high degree of confidence in its security.
