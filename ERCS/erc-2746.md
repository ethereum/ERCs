## Simple Summary
An interface for using a smart contract as a rules engine.  A single deployed contract can register a data domain, create sets of rules that perform actions on that domain, and then invoke a set as an atomic transaction. 

## Abstract
This standard proposes an interface that will allow the creation of hierarchal sets of rules (i.e., RuleTrees) that can be invoked to evaluate and manipulate a registered data domain.  At the time of this draft, all intentions to insert additional functionality onto the blockchain requires the coding and creation of a newly deployed contract.  However, this standard will allow users to deploy a contract just once, one which will then allow them to create (and invoke) pipelines of commands within that contract.

## Motivation
At the time of this draft, all development for Ethereum requires writing the code that forms smart contracts and then deploying those contracts to Ethereum.  In order to create a proper contract, many considerations must be taken into account when designing and implementing the code, especially in terms of efficiency (i.e., gas cost) and security.  Even the simplest contracts require a certain amount of vigilance and examination, before and after deployment. These requirements pertain to all cases, even for simple cases of examining a value and/or altering it.

These technical challenges might form an obstacle for many others who might wish to create software around Ethereum.  Less technical companies and users might also want to configure and deploy simple functionality onto the chain, without knowing the relevant languages or details necessary.  By having the data domain and the predefined actions (i.e., types of rules) implemented along with this interface, a deployed instance of such a rules engine contract can provide efficient and safe functionality to no-code or little-code clients, allowing more users of various technical proficiency to interact with the Ethereum ecosystem.

## Specification
For the clarification of terminology, an Attribute is a registered data point within the data domain, representing data that exists either in the rules engine contract or elsewhere.  A Rule is an predefined action that occurs upon a single data point (i.e., Attribute) in the predefined data domain.  For example, a Rule could check whether the Attribute 'TokenAmt' has a value less than the RHL (i.e., right-hand value) of 10.   A RuleSet is a collection of Rules, where their collection invocation creates a boolean result that determines the navigational flow of execution between RuleSets.  A RuleTree is a collection of RuleSets that are organized within a hierarchy, where RuleSets can contain other RuleSets.

### Considerations

An argument could be made for interface functions that allow a RuleTree's owner to include others users as executors of the RuleTree.

Another argument could be made for interface functions that allow an administrator to configure the origin point of an Attribute, such as whether the Attribute's value comes from a data structure (internal to the rules engine contract) or from calling a contract method (like an implementation of the [Diamond Standard](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/2535)).

Yet another argument could be made for interface functions that allow an administrator to extend the functionality catalog provided by the rules engine, by allowing other contracts' methods to be added as a rule operation.

Also, an argument could be made for functions that calculate and report the range of potential cost for invoking a RuleTree.  Unlike the normal execution of a contract method, the Ethereum transaction costs of invoking a RuleTree are more dynamic, depending on its depth/breadth and the navigational flow during invocation.  Since the general cost of a RuleTree is unknown until the time of invocation, these functions could report the minimal amount of gas for a transaction (i.e., none of the Rules in a RuleTree are invoked) and the maximum amount for a transaction (i.e., all Rules in a RuleTree are invoked).

### Example

A company wishes to deploy a contract with data points and functionality that are predefined and/or under the control of an administrator, and it aims to build a no-code client that will allow less-technical users to define actions within the rules engine contract.  In this example, the company wants one of its users to write the rules in a proprietary markup language, in order for the calculation of a VAT to be determined.  For the sake of transparency, [these rules](https://ipfs.infura.io/ipfs/QmPrZ9959c7SzzqdLkVgX28xM7ZrqLeT3ydvRAHCaL1Hsn) are published onto IPFS, so that they are accessible to auditors and possibly government officials.  The no-code client will then know how to parse the rules from the markup and communicate with the rules engine contract, establishing the RuleTree to be invoked later by the company's user(s) or off-chain programs.

In order to calculate the value of the VAT, these provided rules invoke simple mathematical operations that can perform the calculation.  However, the implementation of the rules engine contract could possess other functionality called by rules, ones that could execute more complicated logic or call the methods of other contracts.

## Rationale

### Attributes

The data points are abstracted in order to let the implementation provide the mechanism for retrieving/populating the data.  Data can be held by an internal data structure, another contract's method, or any number of other options.

### Events

The events specified will help the caller of the RuleTree after execution, so that they may ascertain the navigational flow of RuleSet execution within the RuleTree and so that they may understand which RuleSets failed.

### Right-Hand Value

In the function addRule(), the data type for the right-hand value is 'string' since the rule's action depends on its type, meaning that the value must be provided in a generic form.  In the case of a Rule that performs numerical operations, the provided value could be transformed into a number when stored in the Rule.

## Implementation
- [Wonka](https://github.com/Nethereum/Wonka/tree/master/Solidity/WonkaEngine)
- [Wonka Rules Editor](https://github.com/jaerith/WonkaRulesBlazorEditor)

The Wonka implementation supports this proposed interface and also implements all of the additional considerations mentioned above. 

## Security Considerations

The deployer of the contract should be the owner and administrator, allowing for the addition of Attributes and RuleTrees.  Since a RuleTree is owned by a particular EOA (or contract address), the only accounts that should be able to execute the RuleTree should be its owner or the contract's owner/administrator.  If Attributes are defined to exist as data within other contracts, the implementation must take into account the possibility that RuleTree owners must have the security to access the data in those contracts.
