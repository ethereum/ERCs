## Abstract

This EIP proposes the establishment of a comprehensive metadata standard for Cultural and Historical Asset Tokens
(CHATs) on the Ethereum platform. These tokens represent cultural and historical assets such as artwork, artifacts,
collectibles, and rare items, providing crucial context and provenance to substantiate their significance and value.

While existing NFT standards ensure the immutability and decentralized ownership of assets on the blockchain, based on
our research they do not adequately capture the cultural and historical importance and value of such assets needed for
widespread adoption by institutions such as museums. The CHAT standard aims to overcome these limitations by preserving
the provenance, history, and evolving context of cultural and historical assets, thus substantiating their value.
Furthermore, it incentivises museums, institutions, and asset owners to create tamper-proof records on the blockchain,
ensuring transparency and accountability and accelerating adoption of web3 protocols. Additionally, the CHAT standard
promotes interoperability with existing metadata standards in the arts and cultural sector, facilitating the search,
discovery, and connection of distributed assets.

## Motivation

**Preserving context and significance** - Provenance and context are crucial for cultural and historical assets. The
CHAT standard captures and preserves the provenance and history of these assets, as well as the changing contexts that
emerge from new knowledge and information. This context and provenance substantiate the significance and value of
cultural and historical assets.

**Proof-based preservation** - The recent incidents of lost artifacts and data breaches at a number of significant
international museums points to a need in reassessing our current record keeping mechanisms. While existing systems
mostly operate on trust, blockchain technology offers opportunities to establish permanent and verifiable records in a
proof-based environment. Introducing the CHAT standard on the Ethereum platform enables museums, institutions, and
owners of significant collections to create tamper-proof records on the blockchain. By representing these valuable
cultural and historical assets as tokens on the blockchain, permanent and tamper-proof records can be established
whenever amendments are made, ensuring greater transparency and accountability.

**Interoperability** - The proposed standard addresses the multitude of existing metadata standards used in the arts and
cultural sector. The vision is to create a metadata structure specifically built for preservation on the blockchain that
is interoperable with these existing standards and compliant with the Open Archives Initiative (OAI) as well as the
International Image Interoperability Framework protocol (IIIF).

**Search and Discovery** - Ownership and history of artworks, artifacts, and historical intellectual properties are
often distributed. Although there may never be a fully consolidated archive, a formalized blockchain-based metadata
structure enables consolidation for search and discovery of the assets, without consolidating the ownership. For
example, an artifact from an archaeological site of the Silk Road can be connected with Buddhist paintings, statues, and
texts about the ancient trade route across museum and institutional collections internationally. The proposed CHAT
metadata structure will facilitate easy access to these connections for the general public, researchers, scholars, other
cultural professionals, brands, media, and any other interested parties.

Currently, the [ERC-721](./eip-721.md) standard includes a basic metadata extension, which optionally provides functions
for identifying NFT collections ("name" and "symbol") and attributes for representing assets ("name," "description,"
and "image"). However, to provide comprehensive context and substantiate the value of tokenized assets, NFT issuers
often create their own metadata structures. We believe that the basic extension alone is insufficient to capture the
context and significance of cultural and historical assets. The lack of interoperable and consistent rich metadata
hinders users' ability to search, discover, and connect tokenized assets on the blockchain. While connectivity among
collections may not be crucial for NFTs designed for games and memberships, it is of utmost importance for cultural and
historical assets. As the number and diversity of tokenized assets on the blockchain increase, it becomes essential to
establish a consistent and comprehensive metadata structure that provides context, substantiates value, and enables
connected search and discovery at scale.

## Specification

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT
RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.

This EIP extends [ERC-721](./eip-721.md) and [ERC-1155](./eip-1155.md) with 48 additional properties to capture the
cultural and historical significance of the underlying asset.

Compatible contracts, besides implementing the relevant metadata schemas ("Metadata JSON Schema" for
[ERC-721](./eip-721.md) contracts or "Metadata URI JSON Schema" for [ERC-1155](./eip-1155.md) contracts), must implement
the following metadata interface.

### Cultural and Historical Asset Metadata Extension TypeScript Interface

The following TypeScript interface defines the Metadata JSON Schema compatible tokens must conform to:

    image?: string;                             // A URI pointing to a resource with mime type image/* to serve as the
                                                // cover image of the CHAT
    attributes?: CHATAttribute[];               // A list of attributes to describe the CHAT. Attribute object may be

#### Example

To illustrate the use of the CHAT metadata extension, we provide an example of a CHAT metadata JSON file for the famous
Japanese woodblock print "Under the Wave off Kanagawa" by Katsushika Hokusai, which is currently held by the  Art
Institute of Chicago.

The metadata format is compatible with the [ERC-721](./eip-721.md) and OpenSea style metadata format.

{
  "name": "Under the Wave off Kanagawa (Kanagawa oki nami ura), also known as The Great Wave, from the series “Thirty-Six Views of Mount Fuji (Fugaku sanjūrokkei)",
  "description": "Katsushika Hokusai’s much celebrated series, Thirty-Six Views of Mount Fuji (Fugaku sanjûrokkei), was begun in 1830, when the artist was 70 years old. This tour-de-force series established the popularity of landscape prints, which continues to this day. Perhaps most striking about the series is Hokusai’s copious use of the newly affordable Berlin blue pigment, featured in many of the compositions in the color for the sky and water. Mount Fuji is the protagonist in each scene, viewed from afar or up close, during various weather conditions and seasons, and from all directions.\n\nThe most famous image from the set is the “Great Wave” (Kanagawa oki nami ura), in which a diminutive Mount Fuji can be seen in the distance under the crest of a giant wave. The three impressions of Hokusai’s Great Wave in the Art Institute are all later impressions than the first state of the design.",

## Rationale

### Choosing to Extend Off-Chain Metadata JSON Schema over On-Chain Interface

Both the [ERC-721](./eip-721.md) and [ERC-1155](./eip-1155.md) provide natural extension points in the metadata JSON
file associated with NFTs to supply enriched datasets about the underlying assets.

Providing enriched datasets through off-chain metadata JSON files allows existing NFT contracts to adopt the new
metadata structure proposed in this EIP without upgrading or migrating. The off-chain design enables flexible and
progressive enhancement of any NFT collections to adopt this standard gradually. This approach allows NFT collections to
be deployed using already-audited and battle-tested smart contract code without creating or adapting new smart
contracts, reducing the risk associated with adopting and implementing a new standard.

### Capturing Attributes Extensions in `attributes` and `attributesExt` properties

In the design of the Cultural and Historical Asset Token (CHAT) metadata extension, we have made a deliberate choice to
capture the metadata attributes between two main properties: `attributes` and `attributesExt`. This division serves
two distinct purposes while ensuring maximum compatibility with existing NFT galleries and marketplaces.

**1. `attributes` Property**

The `attributes` property contains core metadata attributes that are integral to the identity and categorization of
CHATs. These attributes are meant to be readily accessible, displayed, and searchable by NFT galleries and marketplaces.
By placing fundamental details such as the CHAT's name, description, image, and other key characteristics
in `attributes`, we ensure that these essential elements can be easily presented to users, collectors, and researchers.
This approach allows CHATs to seamlessly integrate with existing NFT platforms and marketplaces without requiring major
modifications.

**2. `attributesExt` Property**

The `attributesExt` property, on the other hand, is dedicated to extended attributes that provide valuable, in-depth
information about a CHAT but are not typically intended for display or search within NFT galleries and marketplaces.
These extended attributes serve purposes such as archival documentation, provenance records, and additional context that
may not be immediately relevant to a casual observer or collector. By isolating these extended attributes
in `attributesExt`, we strike a balance between comprehensiveness and user-friendliness. This approach allows CHAT
creators to include rich historical and contextual data without overwhelming the typical user interface, making the
extended information available for scholarly or specialized use cases.

This division of attributes into `attributes` and `attributesExt` ensures that the CHAT standard remains highly
compatible with existing NFT ecosystems, while still accommodating the specific needs of cultural and historical assets.
Users can enjoy a seamless experience in browsing and collecting CHATs, while researchers and historians have access to
comprehensive information when required, all within a framework that respects the practicalities of both user interfaces
and extended data documentation.

## Backwards Compatibility

This EIP is fully backward compatible with [ERC-721](./eip-721.md) and [ERC-1155](./eip-1155.md).

## Security Considerations

NFT platforms and systems working with Cultural and Historical Asset Metadata JSON files are recommended to treat the
files as client-supplied data and follow the appropriate best practices for processing such data.

Specifically, when processing the URI fields, backend systems should take extra care to prevent a malicious issuer from
exploiting these fields to perform Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).

Frontend or client-side systems are recommended to escape all control characters that may be exploited to perform
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

Processing systems should manage resource allocation to prevent the systems from being vulnerable to Denial of Service (
DOS) attacks or circumventing security protection through arbitrary code exceptions. Improper processing of variable
data, such as strings, arrays, and JSON objects, may result in a buffer overflow. Therefore, it is crucial to allocate
resources carefully to avoid such vulnerabilities.

The metadata JSON files and the digital resources representing both the token and underlying assets should be stored in
a decentralized storage network to preserve the integrity and to ensure the availability of data for long-term
preservation.

Establishing the authenticity of the claims made in the Metadata JSON file is beyond the scope of this EIP, and is left
to future EIPs to propose an appropriate protocol.
