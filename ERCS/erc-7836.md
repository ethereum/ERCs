## Abstract

This proposal defines complementary JSON-RPC methods to [EIP-5792's `wallet_sendCalls`](./eip-5792.md) to enable an Application to sign over a call bundle (instead of the Wallet). Methods defined in this proposal are purposed for the Application to sign over `calls` and submit them to the Wallet with an accompanying signature. This is in contrast to `wallet_sendCalls`, where a Wallet itself signs over the call bundle.

## Motivation

Applications are increasingly seeking to use session keys and scoped permissions to make transactions on a user's behalf, without the user having to approve and sign each transaction in their wallet's interface. One example is an application that automates a user's decentralised exchange trading. As Smart Contract Accounts (SCAs) contain arbitrary execution interfaces that lead to varying calldata formats, it is not possible for an Application to know how to sign over an action for any arbitrary Account implementation, without maintaining a mapping of Account implementations to their signing logic. Apps need a simple way to request the payload that their session keys should sign, given a call or set of calls they wish to make, and a way to execute the calls once signed.

## Specification

In this specification, we define two new JSON-RPC methods: `wallet_prepareCalls` and `wallet_sendPreparedCalls`.

### `wallet_prepareCalls`

Instructs a Wallet to prepare a call bundle according to the Account's implementation. It returns a `digest` of the call bundle to sign over, as well as the parameters required to fulfil a `wallet_sendPreparedCalls` request (ie. `capabilities`, `chainId`, `context`, and `version`).

> After calling `wallet_prepareCalls`, consumers are expected to sign over the `digest` and submit the `signature` and prepared calls to the Wallet via `wallet_sendPreparedCalls`.

#### Request

> The request is identical to that of [`wallet_sendCalls`](./eip-5792.md).

```typescript
type Request = {
  method: 'wallet_prepareCalls',
  params: [{
    // Calls to be executed.
    calls: {
      to: `0x${string}`;
      data?: `0x${string}`;
      value?: `0x${string}`;
      capabilities?: Record<string, any>;
    }[];
    // Capabilities.
    capabilities?: Record<string, any>
    // Chain ID of the chain the calls are being submitted to.
    chainId: `0x${string}`;
    // Sender address.
    from?: `0x${string}`;
    // Key (hint) that will be used to sign the call bundle.
    key?: {
      // Whether the digest will be prehashed by the key (default behavior of WebCrypto APIs).
      prehash?: boolean,
      // Public key.
      publicKey: `0x${string}`,
      // Key type.
      type: 'secp256k1' | 'p256' | 'webauthn-p256'
    };
    // JSON-RPC method version.
    version: string;
  }]
}
```

#### Response

> The response is intended to be forwarded to `wallet_sendPreparedCalls` (minus the `digest`).

```typescript
type Response = {
  // Capabilities to be forwarded to `wallet_sendPreparedCalls`.
  capabilities: Record<string, any>
  // Chain ID of the chain the calls are being submitted to.
  chainId: `0x${string}`
  // Data specific to the Wallet to be forwarded to `wallet_sendPreparedCalls` 
  // (e.g. ERC-4337 UserOperation or alternative).
  context: unknown
  // Key (hint) that will be used to sign the call bundle.
  key?: {
    // Whether the digest will be prehashed by the key (default behavior of WebCrypto APIs).
    prehash: boolean,
    // Public key.
    publicKey: `0x${string}`,
    // Key type.
    type: 'secp256k1' | 'p256' | 'webauthn-p256' | 'webcrypto-p256'
  },
  // Digest of the call bundle to sign over.
  digest: `0x${string}`
  // JSON-RPC method version.
  version: string
}
```

#### Example

```typescript
const response = await provider.request({
  method: 'wallet_prepareCalls',
  params: [{
    calls: [{
      to: '0xcafebabecafebabecafebabecafebabecafebabe',
      data: '0xdeadbeef',
    }],
    capabilities: {
      paymasterService: {
        url: 'https://...',
      },
    },
    chainId: '0x1',
    key: {
      prehash: false,
      publicKey: '0xdeadbeefdeadbeefdeadbeefdeadbeefdeadbeefdeadbeefdeadbeefdeadbeef',
      type: 'p256',
    },
    version: '1',
  }]
})
/**
 * {
 *   capabilities: {
 *     paymasterService: {
 *       url: 'https://...'
 *     }
 *   },
 *   chainId: '0x1',
 *   context: { ... },
 *   digest: '0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef',
 *   key: {
 *     prehash: false,

 *     type: 'p256',
 *   },
 *   version: '1',
 * }
 */
```

### `wallet_sendPreparedCalls`

Instructs a Wallet to execute a prepared call bundle (response of `wallet_prepareCalls`) with an accompanying `signature`. 

#### Parameters

> The request is identical to the response of `wallet_prepareCalls`, except that it includes a `signature`.

```typescript
type Request = {
  method: 'wallet_sendPreparedCalls',
  params: [{
    // Capabilities.
    capabilities: Record<string, any>
    // Chain ID of the chain the calls are being submitted to.
    chainId: `0x${string}`
    // Data specific to the Wallet from the `wallet_prepareCalls` response.
    // (e.g. ERC-4337 UserOperation or alternative).
    context: unknown
    // Key that was used to sign the call bundle.
    key: {
      // Whether the digest will be prehashed by the key (default behavior of WebCrypto APIs).
      prehash?: boolean,
      // Public key.
      publicKey: `0x${string}`,
      // Key type.
      type: 'secp256k1' | 'p256' | 'webauthn-p256' | 'webcrypto-p256'
    },
    // Signature of the call bundle.
    signature: `0x${string}`
    // JSON-RPC method version.
    version: string
  }]
}
```

#### Response

> The response is identical to that of `wallet_sendCalls`, except that it is a list.

```typescript
type Response = {
  id: string,
  capabilities: Record<string, any>
}[]
```

#### Example

```typescript
const { digest, ...request } = await provider.request({
  method: 'wallet_prepareCalls',
  params: [{
    calls: [{
      to: '0xcafebabecafebabecafebabecafebabecafebabe',
      data: '0xdeadbeef',
    }],
    capabilities: {
      paymasterService: {
        url: 'https://...',
      },
    },
    chainId: '0x1',
    key: {
      prehash: false,
      publicKey: '0xdeadbeefdeadbeefdeadbeefdeadbeefdeadbeefdeadbeefdeadbeefdeadbeef',
      type: 'p256',
    },
    version: '1',
  }]
})

const signature = p256.sign(digest, privateKey)

const response = await provider.request({
  method: 'wallet_sendPreparedCalls',
  params: [{
    ...request,
    signature
  }]
})
/**
 * [
 *   {
 *     id: '0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef',
 *   }
 * ]
 */
```

## Rationale

These endpoints extend the interface established by EIP-5792, given the emergent needs of application developers.

Adding new endpoints for this specific use case is simpler than adding additional options to the `wallet_sendCalls` endpoint.

Surfacing the prepared calls should be relatively simple for wallets, who already need to do preparation internally in order to support `wallet_sendCalls`, and who then submit signed calls on chain.
