[ERC-8055](./eip-8055.md) introduces a security token to be hosted exclusively by Guardian Shield Administration. It is designed to enforce transparency, fraud resistance, and real-time monitoring across decentralized ecosystems.

[This is the role of [ERC-8055](./eip-8055.md)] is more than a token. It is a framework that security, transparency, and justice can be built upon.

By inheriting from [ERC-20](./eip-20.md), [ERC-8055](./eip-8055.md) maintains compatibility with existing token infrastructure while introducing enhanced security primitives.

- [ERC-20](./eip-20.md) inherits core functionality from [ERC-20](./eip-20.md)
- Optionally integrates [ERC-721](./eip-721.md)

[ERC-8055](./eip-8055.md) is more than a proposal. It’s a statement: that security, transparency, and justice are not optional—they are foundational.

[ERC-8055](./eip-8055.md) is a standalone specification that does not depend on other proposals. It may optionally integrate with [ERC-721](./eip-721.md) for NFT-based access control.
