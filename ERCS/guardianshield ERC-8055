## Abstract

GuardianShield introduces a modular security token standard (ERC-8055) designed to integrate fraud detection, staking mechanics, and liquidity protocols. It enables real-time monitoring, adaptive compliance, and AI-assisted governance across decentralized ecosystems.

## Motivation

Current token standards lack built-in security primitives. GuardianShield addresses this by embedding fraud detection, validator coordination, and investor protection directly into the token architecture. ERC-8055 aims to become the foundational layer for secure asset issuance and management.

## Specification

ERC-8055 builds on ERC-20 and ERC-721, introducing:

- **Guardian Modules**: Smart contracts for fraud detection, staking, and compliance.
- **Validator Mesh**: Distributed validator coordination with slashing and reward mechanics.
- **AI Oracles**: Real-time anomaly detection and governance triggers.
- **Liquidity Anchors**: Automated market-making and capital rotation logic.

## Rationale

Security should not be an afterthought. By standardizing protection mechanisms, ERC-8055 reduces systemic risk and increases investor confidence. It also enables composability with existing DeFi protocols.

## Backwards Compatibility

ERC-8055 is compatible with ERC-20 and ERC-721. Legacy tokens can be wrapped or migrated using GuardianShield adapters.

## Reference Implementation

See [ERC-8055](./eip-8055.md) and [GuardianShield ERC-8055](./guardianshield-ERC8055.md) for full implementation details.

## Security Considerations

GuardianShield modules are designed to be upgradeable and auditable. Validators are incentivized to report anomalies, and AI oracles are sandboxed to prevent manipulation.
