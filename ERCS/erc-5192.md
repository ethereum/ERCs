## Abstract

This standard is an extension of [EIP-721](./eip-721.md). It proposes a minimal interface to make tokens soulbound using the feature detection functionality of [EIP-165](./eip-165.md). A soulbound token is a non-fungible token bound to a single account.

## Motivation

The Ethereum community has expressed a need for non-transferrable, non-fungible, and socially-priced tokens similar to World of Warcraftâ€™s soulbound items. But the lack of a token standard leads many developers to simply throw errors upon a user's invocation of transfer functionalities. Over the long term, this will lead to fragmentation and less composability.

In this document, we outline a minimal addition to [EIP-721](./eip-721.md) that allows wallet implementers to check for a token contract's permanent (non-)transferability using [EIP-165](./eip-165.md).

## Specification

The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY" and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

### Contract Interface

A token with a `uint256 tokenId` may be bound to a receiving account with `function locked(...)` returning `true`. In this case, all [EIP-721](./eip-721.md) functions of the contract that transfer the token from one account to another must throw.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: CC0-1.0
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

interface IERC5192 {
  /// @notice Emitted when the locking status is changed to locked.
  /// @dev If a token is minted and the status is locked, this event should be emitted.
  /// @param tokenId The identifier for a token.
  event Locked(uint256 tokenId);

  /// @notice Emitted when the locking status is changed to unlocked.
  /// @dev If a token is minted and the status is unlocked, this event should be emitted.
  /// @param tokenId The identifier for a token.
  event Unlocked(uint256 tokenId);

  /// @notice Returns the locking status of an Soulbound Token
  /// @dev SBTs assigned to zero address are considered invalid, and queries
  /// about them do throw.
  /// @param tokenId The identifier for an SBT.
  function locked(uint256 tokenId) external view returns (bool);
}
```

To aid recognition that an [EIP-721](./eip-721.md) token implements "soulbinding" via this EIP upon calling [EIP-721](./eip-721.md)'s `function supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceID) external view returns (bool)` with `interfaceID=0xb45a3c0e`, a contract implementing this EIP must return `true`.

## Rationale

The above model is the simplest possible path towards a canonical interface for Soulbound tokens. It reflects upon the numerous Soulbound token implementations that simply revert upon transfers.

## Backwards Compatibility

This proposal is fully backward compatible with [EIP-721](./eip-721.md).

## Security Considerations

There are no security considerations related directly to the implementation of this standard.
