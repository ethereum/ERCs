## Abstract
This proposal introduces a **binary format** to describe a chain specific address. Additionally, it defines a human-readable version of that identifier for improved user experience for user facing interactions.

This is achieved through a versioned, length-prefixed binary envelope that supports arbitrary-length data. The interpretation and serialization rules for the data within this envelope are defined by companion standards ([CAIP-350]), which provide profiles for each chain type.

## Motivation
The address format utilized on Ethereum mainnet ([ERC-55]) is shared by a large number of other blockchains. The format does not include details of the chain on which an interaction should occur. This introduces risk if, for example, a transaction is mistakenly executed on a chain where the address is inaccesible. This risk is particularly pronounced for addresses that represent smart contracts or smart accounts.

This proposal builds on insights from [CAIP-10] and [CAIP-50]. It offers both a binary canonical _Interoperable Address_ format and a human readable _Interoperable Name_ format which:

- Binds together chain identification and the raw address.
- Is compact for usage with cross-chain message passing and intent declaration.
- Includes short, easily verififiable checksums to protect users.
- Extends beyond EVM blockchains.

These features mitigate the risk of an address being incorrectly inputted or mistakenly used on a chain it is not intended for - a risk that is particularly pronounced for addresses that represent smart contracts. 

These features can not be added to existing standards as they are not easily extensible - this one is.

### Comparisons with other standards

#### CAIP-10

[CAIP-10] proposes a standard text format to represent an address on a specific chain (referenced by its [CAIP-2] identifier).

The standard **does not** concern itself with the serialization/deserialization of the chain specific address format. It assumes knowledge the native address format for each chain and doesn’t enforce any serialization or canonicalization rules.

It is trivial to add support for chains to [CAIP-10], but the standard has its drawbacks:

- There is no canonical identifier for a specific address on a specific chain - there could be multiple valid [CAIP-10] addresses pointing to the same target address.
- The format is not optimized for usage within smart contracts as strings are an inefficient way to store data on-chain and [CAIP-10] identifiers lack canonicity.
- It depends on [CAIP-2], which limits the chain reference to 32 characters.

An _Interoperable Name_ contains the components of the [CAIP-10] identifier so backward compatibility should not be an issue. To discern the [CAIP-10] identifier conversion to the binary _Interoperable Address_ representation is not necessary.

## Specification
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.

### Concepts
Interoperable Address
: A binary payload which unambiguously identifies a target address and allows conversion to a human-readable name.

Interoperable Name
: A string representation of an interoperable address, meant to be used by humans.

Target address
: The (address, chain ID) pair a particular Interoperable Address points to.

### Interoperable Address V1 binary format definition
In binary format, addresses MUST have the following encoding:

```
┌─────────┬───────────┬──────────────────────┬────────────────┬───────────────┬─────────┐
│ Version │ ChainType │ ChainReferenceLength │ ChainReference │ AddressLength │ Address │
└─────────┴───────────┴──────────────────────┴────────────────┴───────────────┴─────────┘
```

Where:

Version
: A 2-byte version identifier. For version 1, this must be `0x0001` (big-endian). Future versions SHOULD be standardized in separate ERCs.

ChainType
: A 2-byte value as defined in [CAIP-350], corresponding to a [CAIP-2] _namespace_, which allows users to know how to interpret & display the other two fields.

ChainReferenceLength
: A 1-byte integer encoding the length of ChainReference in bytes. Note that it MAY be zero, in which the Interoperable Address will not include a chain reference.

ChainReference
: Variable length, binary representation of [CAIP-2] chain namespace & reference serialized as explained in the [CAIP-350] profile for the chain type, encoding the chain ID.

AddressLength
: 1-byte integer encoding the length of Address in bytes. Note that it MAY be zero, in which the Interoperable Address will not include an address. It MUST NOT be zero if `ChainReferenceLength` is also zero.

Address
: Variable length field containing the binary format of the address component. For serialization details of different types of addresses see the [CAIP-350] profile for the chain type.

#### Version Compatibility

These rules ensure that future versions of Interoperable Addresses maintain backwards compatibility and consistent behavior across implementations:

- Future versions incompatible with v1 parsing MUST set the most significant bit of the version field to 1
- All versions MUST support both address and chain specification simultaneously  
- All versions MUST serialize to v1 format for checksum calculation, excluding the version field from the hash input
- Interoperable Address versions MAY only be able to represent a subset of the CAIP namespaces.
- Interoperable Address versions MAY assign extra syntactic restrictions on the associated Interoperable Name, coupled to novel semantic meaning (e.g. use of ENS or other naming registries)
- Interoperable Address versions MAY define extra fields for purposes such as storing information on how to display the addresses.

### Interoperable Name format definition

#### Syntax
```bnf
<human readable name> ::= <address> @ <chain> # <checksum>
<address>             ::= [.-:_%a-zA-Z0-9]*
<chain>               ::= [.-:_a-zA-Z0-9]*
<checksum>            ::= [0-9A-F]{8}
```

Where:

Chain
: String representation of [CAIP-2] blockchain identifier, recovered from the binary representation described in the [CAIP-350] profile for the chain type. In the case where `ChainReferenceLength` is zero, it should be the CAIP namespace alone, and no trailing colon. Note that it's not possible to specify a reference without a namespace.

Address
: Chain namespace specific text representation of the address from the binary representation. Mapping between the two described in the [CAIP-350] profile for the chain type. In the case where `AddressLength` is zero, it should be the empty string.

Checksum
: 4-byte checksum calculated by computing the keccak256 hash of the concatenated `ChainType`, `ChainReferenceLength`, `ChainReference`, `AddressLength` and `Address` fields of the binary representation (that is, the v1 binary representation skipping the `Version` field), and truncating all but the first 4 bytes of the output. Represented as a base16 string as defined in [RFC 4648].

## Rationale
- Chain and address fields' syntax is deliberately chosen to be able to express [CAIP-2] namespaces (by using the `@` symbol for the separator, freeing up `:`) and [CAIP-10] account IDs, with the caveat that no length restriction is placed, so chains with longer address formats or full 256-bit EVM chainids can be represented.
- Similarly, the address field includes `%` as a valid character to allow for url-encoding of any other characters.
- While a fresh start on text-encoding schemes could e.g. make use of more characters with base58 or base64 to achieve greater information efficiency and/or abstract which chain the address exists on as an implementation detail, a more familiar approach was chosen since:
    - It makes the Interoperable Address <-> raw address relationship evident to the user, which will make the cases where the former are not (yet) supported by a dapp or hardware wallet easier to reason with, as users will evidently see the address is the same, but it's the chain&checksum that is being trimmed.
    - Its extra human-readability will make it more useful as a a stopgap solution until a standard focused on chain and address names is finalized.
- We chose to support zero-length addresses and chainids to be able to use just one standard to represent both potentially foreign _target addresses_ (e.g. the recipient of a cross-chain message) and also plain addresses or chainids (e.g. to specify the origin-chain hook address of a cross-chain message), for greater uniformity across implementations.

Note the version field is removed before hashing.

## Security Considerations
While this standard aims to be a foundation to be able to canonically refer to addresses on different chains, that guarantee is going to be a leaky abstraction in the real world, given that e.g. a particular chain namespace might define a serialization scheme that can't guarantee canonicity of addresses, or a given network might have two valid [CAIP-2] ids referring to it.

It is therefore advised for implementers requiring canonicity of addresses (e.g by using them as keys in smart contract mappings or other key-value stores), to thoroughly review the [CAIP-350] profile of a chain namespace for the possibility of a lack of canonicity of addresses (which should be noted in the profile's 'Extra Considerations' section) as well as collisions with other already-supported namespaces.
