## Abstract
This proposal introduces a **binary format** to describe a chain specific address. Additionally, it defines a human-readable version of that identifier for improved user experience for user facing interactions.

This is achieved through a versioned, length-prefixed binary envelope that supports arbitrary-length data. The interpretation and serialization rules for the data within this envelope are defined by companion standards ([CAIP-350]), which provide profiles for each chain type.

## Motivation
The address format utilized on Ethereum mainnet is shared by a large number of other blockchains. The format does not include details of the chain on which an interaction should occur. This introduces risk if, for example, a transaction is mistakenly executed on a chain where the address is inaccesible. This risk is particularly pronounced for addresses that represent smart contracts or smart accounts.

([ERC-55]) outlines an **optional** checksum standard which means that mistyped addresses can be accepted by clients without the user being aware.

This proposal builds on insights from [CAIP-10] and [CAIP-50]. It offers both a binary canonical _Interoperable Address_ format and a human readable _Interoperable Name_ format which:

- Binds together chain identification and the raw address.
- Is compact for usage with cross-chain message passing and intent declaration.
- Includes short, easily verififiable checksums to protect users.
- Extends beyond EVM blockchains.

These features mitigate the risk of an address being incorrectly inputted or mistakenly used on a chain it is not intended for - a risk that is particularly pronounced for addresses that represent smart contracts. 

These features can not be added to existing standards as they are not easily extensible - this one is.

### Comparisons with other standards

#### CAIP-10

[CAIP-10] proposes a standard text format to represent an address on a specific chain (referenced by its [CAIP-2] identifier).

The standard **does not** concern itself with the serialization/deserialization of the chain specific address format.

It is trivial to add support for chains to [CAIP-10], but the standard has its drawbacks:

- There is no canonical identifier for a specific address on a specific chain - there could be multiple valid [CAIP-10] addresses pointing to the same target address.
- The format is not optimized for usage within smart contracts as strings are an inefficient way to store data on-chain and [CAIP-10] identifiers lack canonicity.
- It depends on [CAIP-2], which limits the chain reference to 32 characters.

## Specification
The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.

### Terminology
**Target Address**
: The target address being represented. Serialized subject to the rules outlined in the [CAIP-350] profile for the namespace of the chain being targeted.

**Interoperable Address**
: A binary payload which unambiguously identifies a target address on a target chain.

**Interoperable Name**
: A string representation of an _Interoperable Address_, meant to be used by humans.

### Binary Format Definition

An _Interoperable Address_ as defined by this standard MUST have the following binary format:

```
┌─────────┬───────────┬──────────────────────┬────────────────┬───────────────┬─────────┐
│ Version │ ChainType │ ChainReferenceLength │ ChainReference │ AddressLength │ Address │
└─────────┴───────────┴──────────────────────┴────────────────┴───────────────┴─────────┘
```

The components outlined above have the following meanings:

**Version**
: A 2-byte version identifier. For version 1 (this specification), this must be `0x0001` (big-endian). Future versions SHOULD be standardized in separate ERCs.

**ChainType**
: A 2-byte value as defined in [CAIP-350], corresponding to a [CAIP-2] namespace, which allows users to know how to interpret and display the _ChainReference_ and the _Address_.

**ChainReferenceLength**
: A 1-byte integer encoding the length of _ChainReference_ in bytes. Note that it MAY be zero, in which case the _Interoperable Address_ MUST NOT include a chain reference.

**ChainReference**
: Variable length, binary representation of the [CAIP-2] chain ID. To discern how to serialize the _ChainReference_ for a specific chain type, implementors MUST reference the respective [CAIP-350] profile. Chain profiles are maintained by the Chain-Agnostic Standards Alliance (CASA).

**AddressLength**
: 1-byte integer encoding the length of Address in bytes. Note that it MAY be zero, in which case the _Interoperable Address_ MUST NOT include an address. It MUST NOT be zero if the _ChainReferenceLength_ is also zero.

**Address**
: Variable length field containing the binary encoding of the address. The serialization for a specific _ChainType_ MUST follow the rules of its corresponding [CAIP-350] profile.

### Interoperable Name Definition

Recall that an _Interoperable Name_ is a human readable representation of an underlying _Interoperable Address_.

It's format is `<address> @ <chain> # <checksum>` where the components match the following regular expressions:

#### Syntax
```bnf
<address>             ::= [.-:_%a-zA-Z0-9]*
<chain>               ::= [.-:_a-zA-Z0-9]*
<checksum>            ::= [0-9A-F]{8}
```

These components have the following meanings:

`<address>` is the text representation of an address for the chain namespace in question. 

`<chain>` is the string representation of a specific blockchain as defined in [CAIP-2]. For example `eip155:1` for Ethereum Mainnet.

If you are representing an address for a namespace more generally it MUST be set to the CAIP namespace with no trailing colon. For example `eip155`.

The 4-byte `<checksum>` is the first 4 bytes of the hexadecimal ([RFC 4648]) string representation of a keccak256 hash. This hash is computed over the concatenation of the _Interoperable Address_'s binary fields: `ChainType`, `ChainReferenceLength`, `ChainReference`, `AddressLength`, and `Address`. The `Version` field MUST NOT be included in the hashed data.

#### Checksums

A 4-byte checksum MUST be computed and included when sharing an _Interoperable Name_. 

If a user-provided _Interoperable Name_ includes a checksum, clients MUST derive the underlying _Interoperable Address_, recalculate the checksum, and compare it to the provided value. In case of a mismatch, clients MUST warn the user and require explicit user input to continue with the operation.

Clients MAY include the checksum when displaying an _Interoperable Name_ within their interface.
Clients MAY accept _Interoperable Name_ inputs without a checksum.

### Parsing and Serialization:

When parsing an _Interoperable Name_ to generate its binary _Interoperable Address_, clients MUST follow the normalization and serialization rules defined in the relevant [CAIP-350] profile for the given `<chain>` and `<address>`. This ensures that different valid text representations (e.g., case variations in an address) resolve to a single, canonical binary form, which is essential for consistent checksum calculation and data integrity.

### Versioning

These rules ensure that future standards that build upon this one maintain backwards compatibility.

Future versions:

- MUST set the most significant bit of the version field to 1 if the _Interoperable Address_ format is not backward-compatible with the parsing rules outlined herein
- MUST support defining an address, a chain, or both
- MUST allow the client to discern the data necessary to calculate the checksum as outlined in this standard
- MAY only be able to represent a subset of the CAIP namespaces
- MAY modify the syntactic restrictions of the _Interoperable Name_ definition but MUST ensure that any binary data derived from such name resolution strictly conforms to the _Interoperable Address_ encoding defined in this specification.
- MAY define extra fields

## Rationale

- The `@` symbol is used as a separator as it provides visual clarity to humans, is easy for software to parse, and avoids confusion with the colon (`:`) symbol utilized in [CAIP-2] identifiers. 
- No length restriction is placed on addresses, allowing for chains with longer address formats to be represented.
- The address field includes `%` as a valid character to allow for URL-encoded address formats.
- We chose to support zero-length addresses and chain IDs to make this standard flexible and to allow developers to use a single, uniform standard for many different jobs.
- We chose **not** to utilize alternate encoding formats (`base58` or `base64` for example) to reduce the size of the _Interoperable Address_ and/or to abstract away namespace specific address serialization standards. We decided that using the chain specific address formats that users are used to provides a better user experience.


## Security Considerations
This standard aims to be a foundation to allow for canonical representations of chain specific addresses. In the real world it can not be guaranteed that there will only be one valid representation of a chain specific address. For example, a particular chain namespace might define a serialization scheme that can't guarantee canonicity of addresses, or a given network might have two valid [CAIP-2] IDs referring to it.

It is therefore advised that implementers requiring canonicity of addresses (if for example you are using them as keys in smart contract mappings), to thoroughly review the [CAIP-350] profile of a chain namespace for the possibility of a lack of canonicity. These considerations should be noted in the profile's 'Extra Considerations' section.
