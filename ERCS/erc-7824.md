## Abstract

Nitrolite is a lightweight, efficient state channel framework for Ethereum and other EVM-compatible blockchains, enabling off-chain interactions while maintaining on-chain security guarantees. The framework allows participants to perform instant transactions with reduced gas costs while preserving the security of the underlying blockchain.

This standard defines a framework for implementing state channel systems through the Nitrolite protocol, providing interfaces for channel creation, state management, dispute resolution, and fund custody. It enables high-throughput applications with minimal on-chain footprint.

## Motivation

The Ethereum network faces challenges in scalability and transaction costs, making it less feasible for high-frequency interactions. The Nitrolite framework addresses these challenges by providing a lightweight state channel solution that enables:

- **Instant Finality**: Transactions settle immediately between parties
- **Reduced Gas Costs**: Most interactions happen off-chain, with minimal on-chain footprint
- **High Throughput**: Support for thousands of transactions per second
- **Security Guarantees**: Same security as on-chain, with cryptographic proofs
- **Chain Agnostic**: Works with any EVM-compatible blockchain

This ERC standardizes the Nitrolite protocol interfaces to facilitate widespread adoption of state channels.

## Specification

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

### Glossary of Terms

- **Channel**: A relationship between participants that allows off-chain state updates with on-chain settlement
- **Channel ID**: A unique identifier derived from channel configuration (participants, adjudicator, challenge period, nonce)
- **Participant**: An entity (EOA) involved in a state channel
- **State**: A signed data structure containing version, allocations, and application data
- **Allocation**: Specification of token distribution to destinations
- **Adjudicator**: Contract that validates state transitions according to application rules
- **Challenge Period**: Duration for dispute resolution before finalization
- **Status**: Channel lifecycle stage (VOID, INITIAL, ACTIVE, DISPUTE, FINAL)
- **State Intent**: Purpose of a state (OPERATE, INITIALIZE, RESIZE, FINALIZE)
- **Custody**: On-chain contract holding locked funds for channels
- **Checkpoint**: Recording a valid state on-chain without closing the channel

### Data Structures

The Nitrolite protocol defines the following core data structures:

#### Basic Types

```solidity
struct Signature {
    uint8 v;
    bytes32 r;
    bytes32 s;
}

struct Amount {
    address token;   // ERC-20 token address (address(0) for native tokens)
    uint256 amount;  // Token amount
}

struct Allocation {
    address destination;  // Where funds are sent on channel closure
    address token;        // ERC-20 token contract address (address(0) for native tokens)
    uint256 amount;       // Token amount allocated
}
```

#### Channel Configuration

```solidity
struct Channel {
    address[] participants;  // List of participants in the channel
    address adjudicator;     // Address of the contract that validates state transitions
    uint64 challenge;        // Duration in seconds for dispute resolution period
    uint64 nonce;           // Unique per channel with same participants and adjudicator
}
```

#### State Structure

```solidity
struct State {
    StateIntent intent;      // Intent of the state
    uint256 version;         // State version incremental number to compare most recent
    bytes data;             // Application data encoded, decoded by the adjudicator
    Allocation[] allocations; // Asset allocation and destination for each participant
    Signature[] sigs;        // stateHash signatures from participants
}

enum StateIntent {
    OPERATE,    // Normal operation state
    INITIALIZE, // Initial funding state
    RESIZE,     // Resize allocations state
    FINALIZE    // Final closing state
}
```

#### Channel Status

```solidity
enum Status {
    VOID,     // Channel was not created, State.version must be 0
    INITIAL,  // Channel is created and in funding process, State.version must be 0
    ACTIVE,   // Channel fully funded and operational, State.version > 0
    DISPUTE,  // Challenge period is active
    FINAL     // Final state, channel can be closed
}
```

#### Channel ID

The channel ID is computed as:

```solidity
bytes32 channelId = keccak256(
    abi.encode(
        channel.participants,
        channel.adjudicator,
        channel.challenge,
        channel.nonce
    )
);
```

#### State Hash

For signature verification, the state hash is computed as:

```solidity
bytes32 stateHash = keccak256(
    abi.encode(
        channelId,
        state.data,
        state.version,
        state.allocations
    )
);
```

Note: The stateHash is bare signed without EIP-191 since the protocol is intended to be chain-agnostic.

### Interfaces

#### IAdjudicator

Defines the interface for contracts that validate state transitions according to application-specific rules:

```solidity
interface IAdjudicator {
    /**
     * @notice Validates a candidate state based on application-specific rules
     * @dev Used to determine if a state is valid during challenges or checkpoints
     * @param chan The channel configuration
     * @param candidate The proposed state to be validated
     * @param proofs Array of previous states that provide context for validation
     * @return valid True if the candidate state is valid according to application rules
     */
    function adjudicate(
        Channel calldata chan,
        State calldata candidate,
        State[] calldata proofs
    ) external view returns (bool valid);
}
```

#### IComparable

Interface for determining the ordering between states:

```solidity
interface IComparable {
    /**
     * @notice Compares two states to determine their relative ordering
     * @dev Returns: -1 if candidate < previous, 0 if equal, 1 if candidate > previous
     * @param candidate The state being evaluated
     * @param previous The reference state to compare against
     * @return result The comparison result
     */
    function compare(
        State calldata candidate,
        State calldata previous
    ) external view returns (int8 result);
}
```

#### IChannel

The main state channel interface that manages the channel lifecycle:

```solidity
interface IChannel {
    // Events
    event Created(bytes32 indexed channelId, Channel channel, State initial);
    event Joined(bytes32 indexed channelId, uint256 index);
    event Opened(bytes32 indexed channelId);
    event Challenged(bytes32 indexed channelId, uint256 expiration);
    event Checkpointed(bytes32 indexed channelId);
    event Resized(bytes32 indexed channelId, int256[] deltaAllocations);
    event Closed(bytes32 indexed channelId);

    /**
     * @notice Creates a new channel and initializes funding
     * @dev The creator must sign the funding state with StateIntent.INITIALIZE
     * @param ch Channel configuration
     * @param initial Initial state with StateIntent.INITIALIZE and expected allocations
     * @return channelId Unique identifier for the created channel
     */
    function create(Channel calldata ch, State calldata initial)
        external returns (bytes32 channelId);

    /**
     * @notice Allows a participant to join a channel by signing the funding state
     * @dev Participant must provide signature on the same funding state
     * @param channelId Unique identifier for the channel
     * @param index Index of the participant in the channel's participants array
     * @param sig Signature of the participant on the funding state
     * @return channelId Unique identifier for the joined channel
     */
    function join(bytes32 channelId, uint256 index, Signature calldata sig)
        external returns (bytes32);

    /**
     * @notice Finalizes a channel with a mutually signed closing state
     * @dev Requires all participants' signatures on a state with StateIntent.FINALIZE
     * @param channelId Unique identifier for the channel
     * @param candidate The latest known valid state to be finalized
     * @param proofs Additional states required by the adjudicator
     */
    function close(
        bytes32 channelId,
        State calldata candidate,
        State[] calldata proofs
    ) external;

    /**
     * @notice Resizes channel allocations with participant agreement
     * @dev Used for adjusting channel allocations without withdrawing funds
     * @param channelId Unique identifier for the channel
     * @param candidate The state with new allocations
     * @param proofs Supporting states for validation
     */
    function resize(
        bytes32 channelId,
        State calldata candidate,
        State[] calldata proofs
    ) external;

    /**
     * @notice Initiates or updates a challenge with a signed state
     * @dev Starts a challenge period during which participants can respond
     * @param channelId Unique identifier for the channel
     * @param candidate The state being submitted as the latest valid state
     * @param proofs Additional states required by the adjudicator
     */
    function challenge(
        bytes32 channelId,
        State calldata candidate,
        State[] calldata proofs
    ) external;

    /**
     * @notice Records a valid state on-chain without initiating a challenge
     * @dev Used to establish on-chain proof of the latest state
     * @param channelId Unique identifier for the channel
     * @param candidate The state to checkpoint
     * @param proofs Additional states required by the adjudicator
     */
    function checkpoint(
        bytes32 channelId,
        State calldata candidate,
        State[] calldata proofs
    ) external;
}
```

#### IDeposit

Interface for managing token deposits and withdrawals:

```solidity
interface IDeposit {
    /**
     * @notice Deposits tokens into the contract
     * @dev For native tokens, the value should be sent with the transaction
     * @param token Token address (use address(0) for native tokens)
     * @param amount Amount of tokens to deposit
     */
    function deposit(address token, uint256 amount) external payable;

    /**
     * @notice Withdraws tokens from the contract
     * @dev Can only withdraw available (not locked in channels) funds
     * @param token Token address (use address(0) for native tokens)
     * @param amount Amount of tokens to withdraw
     */
    function withdraw(address token, uint256 amount) external;
}
```

### Channel Lifecycle

1. **Creation**: Creator constructs channel config and signs initial state with `StateIntent.INITIALIZE`
2. **Joining**: Participants verify the channel and sign the same funding state
3. **Active**: Once fully funded, the channel transitions to active state for off-chain operation
4. **Off-chain Updates**: Participants exchange and sign state updates according to application logic
5. **Resolution**:
   - **Cooperative Close**: All parties sign a final state with `StateIntent.FINALIZE`
   - **Challenge-Response**: Participant can post a state on-chain and initiate challenge period
   - **Checkpoint**: Record valid state on-chain without closing for future dispute resolution
   - **Resize**: Adjust allocations by agreement without closing the channel

### Example Implementation: Remittance Adjudicator

The Remittance adjudicator validates payment transfers between participants:

```solidity
contract Remittance is IAdjudicator, IComparable {
    struct Intent {
        uint8 payer;      // Index of the paying participant
        Amount transfer;  // Amount and token being transferred
    }

    /**
     * @notice Validates a payment state transition
     * @dev Checks that the payer has signed and allocations are correct
     */
    function adjudicate(
        Channel calldata chan,
        State calldata candidate,
        State[] calldata proofs
    ) external view returns (bool valid) {
        // Decode the payment intent
        Intent memory intent = abi.decode(candidate.data, (Intent));

        // For first state (version 1), need funding state as proof
        if (candidate.version == 1) {
            require(proofs.length >= 1, "Missing funding state");
            State memory funding = proofs[0];
            require(funding.intent == StateIntent.INITIALIZE, "Invalid funding state");
        }

        // For subsequent states, need previous state
        if (candidate.version > 1) {
            require(proofs.length >= 2, "Missing previous state");
            State memory previous = proofs[1];

            // Verify state transition
            require(candidate.version == previous.version + 1, "Invalid version");

            // Verify allocations match the intent
            require(
                candidate.allocations[intent.payer].amount ==
                previous.allocations[intent.payer].amount - intent.transfer.amount,
                "Invalid payer allocation"
            );

            uint8 payee = intent.payer == 0 ? 1 : 0;
            require(
                candidate.allocations[payee].amount ==
                previous.allocations[payee].amount + intent.transfer.amount,
                "Invalid payee allocation"
            );
        }

        // Verify payer has signed
        require(candidate.sigs[intent.payer].v != 0, "Missing payer signature");

        return true;
    }

    /**
     * @notice Compares states by version number
     */
    function compare(
        State calldata candidate,
        State calldata previous
    ) external view returns (int8 result) {
        if (candidate.version < previous.version) return -1;
        if (candidate.version > previous.version) return 1;
        return 0;
    }
}
```

### Example Usage

```solidity
// Create a channel between Alice and Bob
Channel memory channel = Channel({
    participants: [alice, bob],
    adjudicator: address(remittanceAdjudicator),
    challenge: 3600, // 1 hour challenge period
    nonce: 1
});

// Create initial funding state
State memory fundingState = State({
    intent: StateIntent.INITIALIZE,
    version: 0,
    data: "",
    allocations: [
        Allocation(alice, tokenAddress, 100 ether),
        Allocation(bob, tokenAddress, 50 ether)
    ],
    sigs: [aliceSignature, bobSignature]
});

// Alice creates and funds the channel
bytes32 channelId = custody.create(channel, fundingState);

// Bob joins with his signature
custody.join(channelId, 1, bobSignature);

// Off-chain: Alice pays Bob 10 tokens
Intent memory paymentIntent = Intent({
    payer: 0, // Alice is payer
    transfer: Amount(tokenAddress, 10 ether)
});

State memory paymentState = State({
    intent: StateIntent.OPERATE,
    version: 1,
    data: abi.encode(paymentIntent),
    allocations: [
        Allocation(alice, tokenAddress, 90 ether),
        Allocation(bob, tokenAddress, 60 ether)
    ],
    sigs: [aliceSignature, bobSignature]
});

// Either party can checkpoint this state on-chain
custody.checkpoint(channelId, paymentState, [fundingState]);
```

## Rationale

The Nitrolite framework addresses critical blockchain scalability challenges through a lightweight state channel design. This standard provides clear interfaces to ensure interoperability while maintaining flexibility for diverse applications.

**Efficiency**: Nitrolite minimizes on-chain footprint by requiring only essential operations (create, join, close) to occur on-chain, with all application logic executed off-chain. This enables instant finality and dramatically reduces gas costs.

**Modularity**: The separation of concerns between the custody contract (IChannel), state validation (IAdjudicator), and fund management (IDeposit) allows developers to implement custom application logic while leveraging battle-tested infrastructure.

**Flexibility**: The adjudicator pattern supports any application logic - from simple payments to complex multi-step protocols. The state intent system (INITIALIZE, OPERATE, RESIZE, FINALIZE) provides clear semantics for different operation types.

**Security**: The challenge-response mechanism ensures that participants can always recover their funds by posting the latest valid state on-chain. The checkpoint feature allows proactive security by recording states without closing channels.

**Chain Agnostic**: The protocol design avoids chain-specific features, enabling deployment across any EVM-compatible blockchain and facilitating cross-chain applications through the clearnode architecture.

## Backwards Compatibility

No backward compatibility issues found. This ERC is designed to coexist with existing standards and can integrate with [ERC-1271](./erc-1271.md) and [ERC-4337](./erc-4337.md)

## Security Considerations

### On-Chain Security

- **Signature Verification**: All state transitions require valid signatures from participants. The protocol uses bare signatures (without EIP-191) for chain agnosticism.
- **Challenge Period**: The configurable challenge duration provides time for honest participants to respond to invalid states.
- **Adjudicator Validation**: Custom adjudicators must be carefully audited as they control state transition rules.
- **Reentrancy Protection**: Implementation should follow checks-effects-interactions pattern, especially in fund distribution.

### Off-Chain Security

- **State Storage**: Participants must securely store all signed states as they may need them for disputes.
- **Signature Security**: Private keys used for state signing must be protected as compromise allows unauthorized state transitions.
- **Availability**: Participants must monitor the chain for challenges during the challenge period.
- **Front-running**: Challenge transactions may be front-run; implementations should consider commit-reveal schemes if needed.

### Implementation Considerations

- The custody contract strictly enforces 2-participant channels in the reference implementation.
- Adjudicators should validate all state transitions according to application rules.
- Proper nonce management prevents replay attacks across different channels.
