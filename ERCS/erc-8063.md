## Abstract

This proposal specifies a general-purpose "Group" primitive as a first-class, onchain object. Each group is deployed as its own contract (identified by its contract address) and has an owner, an extensible set of members, and optional metadata. The standard defines a minimal interface for inviting and joining members, and membership introspection. Unlike token standards (e.g., [ERC-20](./eip-20.md)/[ERC-721](./eip-721.md)) that model units of transferable ownership, Groups model multi-party membership and coordination. The goal is to enable interoperable social, organizational, and collaborative primitives.

## Motivation

Tokens typically model ownership and transfer. Many applications instead need an addressable set of accounts with controlled join/leave semantics and shared state—e.g., project teams, DAOs, game parties, channels, or access cohorts. While [ERC-7743](./eip-7743.md) (MO-NFT) explores multi-ownership for a single token, it still anchors the abstraction to token semantics. Groups generalize this into a token-agnostic container where members can be added over time, without implying transfer or unitized ownership. Following the [ERC-20](./eip-20.md) design pattern, each group is its own contract identified by its address. External resources (tokens, NFTs, etc.) can be associated with groups through their own contracts, just as they would with any EOA or contract address.

## Specification

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.

Contracts that implement this standard MUST support [ERC-165](./eip-165.md).

### Interface

```solidity
/// SPDX-License-Identifier: CC0-1.0
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

interface IERC165 {
    function supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceId) external view returns (bool);
}

/// @title IERC8063 — Minimal interface for onchain groups
/// @notice A group is a contract with an owner and members
interface IERC8063 is IERC165 {
    /// @dev Emitted when the owner invites an account
    event MemberInvited(address indexed inviter, address indexed invitee);

    /// @dev Emitted when an invited account accepts and becomes a member
    event MemberJoined(address indexed account);

    /// @dev Emitted when a member is removed (cannot remove the owner)
    event MemberRemoved(address indexed account, address indexed by);

    /// @dev Emitted when a member transfers their membership to another address
    event MembershipTransferred(address indexed from, address indexed to);

    /// @notice Returns the owner of the group
    function owner() external view returns (address);

    /// @notice Returns the human-readable name of the group (may be empty)
    function name() external view returns (string memory);

    /// @notice Returns true if `account` is a member of the group
    function isMember(address account) external view returns (bool);

    /// @notice Returns current number of members (including owner)
    function getMemberCount() external view returns (uint256);

    /// @notice Owner invites an account to join the group
    function inviteMember(address account) external;

    /// @notice Invitee accepts an outstanding invite and becomes a member
    function acceptInvite() external;

    /// @notice Owner removes a member (owner cannot be removed)
    function removeMember(address account) external;

    /// @notice Transfer membership to another address (caller loses membership)
    /// @param to Address to receive membership (must not already be a member)
    function transferMembership(address to) external;
}
```

### Semantics

- Group creation: The contract constructor MUST set the deployer as the group owner and initial member. Implementations SHOULD accept a name and optional metadataURI as constructor parameters.
- Invitations: Only the group owner MAY call `inviteMember`. Implementations MUST record an outstanding invitation for `account` and emit `MemberInvited`.
- Joining: `acceptInvite` MUST succeed only for invited accounts, add them as members exactly once, and emit `MemberJoined`.
- Removal: Only the owner MAY call `removeMember`. Implementations MUST NOT allow removing the owner.
- Membership transfer: Any member (except the owner) MAY call `transferMembership` to transfer their membership to a non-member address. The caller MUST lose membership, the recipient MUST become a member, and `MembershipTransferred` MUST be emitted. Member count remains unchanged.
- Introspection: `supportsInterface` MUST return true for `type(IERC165).interfaceId` and for `type(IERC8063).interfaceId`.

### Deployment model

Following the [ERC-20](./eip-20.md) pattern, each group is its own contract deployment:

- **Group identity**: A group is uniquely identified by its contract address, just as an ERC-20 token is identified by its contract address.
- **Deployment**: To create a group, deploy a new contract implementing `IERC8063`. The deployer becomes the owner and initial member.
- **Discovery**: Applications can discover groups through events, registries, or direct address references, similar to token discovery patterns.
- **Naming**: Implementations SHOULD accept a human-readable name in the constructor and expose it via `name()`. Empty names are permitted.

### Optional extensions (non-normative)

- Admin roles: Owner-delegated administrators that can invite/remove members.
- Signature-based invites: Offchain signed invites verifiable onchain for gasless flows.
- Open groups: Opt-in groups without invitations where `acceptInvite` is implicitly allowed for any account.
- Transferable ownership: Allow the owner to transfer ownership to another member.
- Factory contracts: A factory pattern for deploying groups with standardized initialization.
- Resource associations: External contracts (e.g., [ERC-20](./eip-20.md), [ERC-721](./eip-721.md)) MAY track group ownership or membership-based access using the group's contract address.

## Rationale

- **One contract per group**: Following the [ERC-20](./eip-20.md) model where each token is its own contract creates a simpler, more composable design. The contract address becomes the natural group identifier.
- **Token-agnostic**: Separates membership from asset ownership/transfer semantics, suitable for social and coordination use cases.
- **Minimal surface**: Invite/join, membership queries, and transfers are sufficient for broad interoperability while allowing richer policies via extensions.
- **Transferable membership**: Enables members to delegate or reassign their position without owner intervention, supporting use cases like account migration or role handoffs.
- **External resource model**: Resources (tokens, NFTs) can be associated with groups externally, just as they would with any address, avoiding tight coupling and enabling flexible composition.
- **Relationship to [ERC-7743](./eip-7743.md)**: MO-NFT models multi-ownership of a single token; Groups model multi-membership of a container. Implementations MAY associate a Group with tokens, but the standard does not require token interfaces.

## Backwards Compatibility

No known backward compatibility issues. This is a new interface with [ERC-165](./eip-165.md) detection.

## Reference Implementation

Reference contracts are provided in the `assets/` directory:

- `IERC8063.sol` — Interface definition
- `ERC8063.sol` — Minimal reference implementation

## Security Considerations

- Membership griefing: Implementations SHOULD bound per-tx iterations and avoid unbounded member enumeration onchain.
- Invite spoofing: Signature-based invites MUST protect against replay and domain separation if used. The baseline owner-called invites avoid this.
- Access control: Clearly document who can invite and remove members; conservative defaults recommend owner-only operations.
