# ERC-8055: Example ERC Standard

## Abstract
This document defines the ERC-8055 standard for smart contracts that support a compliant interface.

## Introduction
This ERC standard is designed to be irrefutable and ensures proper compliance with ERC standards. It provides a framework for developers to implement compliant contracts.

## ERC Standard Compliance
This standard complies with the ERC guidelines set forth by the Ethereum community.

## Keywords
The keywords **MUST**, **MUST NOT**, **SHOULD**, and **MAY** are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

## Security Considerations
Developers MUST ensure that contracts implementing this standard include measures to prevent reentrancy attacks, overflow/underflow vulnerabilities, and other common security pitfalls. Security audits SHOULD be conducted to validate compliance.

## Solidity Interface Implementation
```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

interface IERC8055 {
    function exampleFunction() external;
    // other function signatures
}
```

## Conclusion
ERC-8055 aims to provide a strong framework for developers to build securely compliant contracts.
