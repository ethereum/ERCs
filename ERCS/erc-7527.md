## Abstract

This proposal outlines interfaces for wrapping [ERC-20](./eip-20.md) or ETH to [ERC-721](./eip-721.md) and unwrap ERC-721 to ERC-20 or ETH. A function oracle feeds mint/burn prices based on an embedded equation of Function Oracle Automated Market Maker(FOAMM), which executes and clears the mint and burn of NFT. 

## Motivation

Liquidity can be a significant challenge in decentralized systems, especially for unique or less commonly traded tokens like NFTs. To foster a trustless NFT ecosystem, the motivation behind Function Oracle Automated Market Maker(FOAMM) is to provide automated pricing solutions for NFTs with liquidity through transparent, smart contract mechanisms. 

This ERC provides innovative solutions for the following aspects: 

- Automated Price Discovery
- Liquidity Enhancement

### Automated Price Discovery 

Transactions under FOAMM can occur without the need for a matching counterparty. When interacting directly with the pool, FOAMM automatically feeds prices based on the oracle with predefined function. 

### Liquidity Enhancement

In traditional DEX models, liquidity is supplied by external parties, known as Liquidity Providers(LP). These LPs deposit tokens into liquidity pools, facilitating exchanges by providing the liquidity. The removal or withdrawal of these LPs can introduce significant volatility, as it directly impacts the available liquidity in the market. 

In a FOAMM system, the liquidity is added or removed internally through `wrap` or `unwrap`. FOAMM reduces reliance on external LPs and mitigates the risk of volatility caused by their sudden withdrawal, as the liquidity is continuously replenished and maintained through ongoing participant interactions.


## Specification

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 and RFC 8174.

Contract Interfaces: 

Three interfaces are included here: `Agency`, `App`, and `Factory`. 

`Agency` and `App` MAY be implemented by the same contract or MAY be separately implemented. If separately implemented, they SHALL be mutually bounded and not upgradable after initialization.

`Agency` and `App` should implement `iconstructor` interface to initialize the parameters within the contract and validate the configuration parameters. If factory is used to deploy `Agency` and `App`, factory will automatically call the two functions when deploying.

`App` SHALL implement `onlyAgency()` modifier and `mint` and `burn` SHALL apply `onlyAgency()` as a modifier, which restricts calls to `Mint` and `Burn` only have effect if they are called through the corresponding `Agency`.

`Agency` is OPTIONAL to implement `onlyApp()`.

The `Factory` interface is OPTIONAL. It is most useful if `Agency` and `App` need to be deployed repeatedly. 

Function Oracle is implemented through `getWrapOracle` and `getUnwrapOracle`, which feeds prices based on parameters and mathematical equations defined in the functions. 

FOAMM is implemented through `wrap` and `unwrap`, which calls `getWrapOracle` and `getUnwrapOracle` to get the feed and automatically clears. To perform `wrap`, FOAMM receives the premium and initiate `mint` in `App`. To perform `unwrap`, FOAMM transfer the premium and initiate `burn` in `App`.

`Agency` serves as a single entry point for all `mint` and `burn` transfer. 

### Agency Interface

```
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

```

### App Interface

`ERC7527App` SHALL inherit `name` from interface `ERC721Metadata`. 

```
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

interface IERC7527App {
    /**
     * @dev Returns the maximum supply of the non-fungible token.
     */
    function getMaxSupply() external view returns (uint256);

    /**

     * @param id The identifier of the non-fungible token.
     */
    function getName(uint256 id) external view returns (string memory);

    /**
     * @dev Returns the agency of the non-fungible token.
     */
    function getAgency() external view returns (address payable);

    /**
     * @dev Constructor of the instance contract.
     */
    function iconstructor() external;

    /**
     * @dev Sets the agency of the non-fungible token.
     * @param agency The agency of the non-fungible token.
     */
    function setAgency(address payable agency) external;

    /**
     * @dev Mints a non-fungible token to `to`.
     * @param to The address of the recipient of the newly created non-fungible token.
     * @param data The data to encode into the newly created non-fungible token.
     */
    function mint(address to, bytes calldata data) external returns (uint256);

    /**
     * @dev Burns a non-fungible token with identifier `tokenId`.

     * @param data The data to encode into the non-fungible token with identifier `tokenId`.
     */
    function burn(uint256 tokenId, bytes calldata data) external;
}
```

Token ID can be specified in `data` parameter of `mint` function. 

### Factory Interface 

If a factory is needed to deploy bounded App and Agency, the factory SHALL implement the following interface:

```
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

import {Asset} from "./IERC7527Agency.sol";

/**
 * @dev The settings of the agency.
 * @param implementation The address of the agency implementation.
 * @param asset The parameter of asset of the agency.
 * @param immutableData The immutable data are stored in the code region of the created proxy contract of agencyImplementation.
 * @param initData If init data is not empty, calls proxy contract of agencyImplementation with this data.
 */
struct AgencySettings {
    address payable implementation;
    Asset asset;
    bytes immutableData;
    bytes initData;
}

/**
 * @dev The settings of the app.
 * @param implementation The address of the app implementation.
 * @param immutableData The immutable data are stored in the code region of the created proxy contract of appImplementation.
 * @param initData If init data is not empty, calls proxy contract of appImplementation with this data.
 */
struct AppSettings {
    address implementation;
    bytes immutableData;
    bytes initData;
}

interface IERC7527Factory {
    /**
     * @dev Deploys a new agency and app clone and initializes both.
     * @param agencySettings The settings of the agency.
     * @param appSettings The settings of the app.
     * @param data The data is additional data, it has no specified format and it is sent in call to `factory`.
     * @return appInstance The address of the created proxy contract of appImplementation.
     * @return agencyInstance The address of the created proxy contract of agencyImplementation.
     */
    function deployWrap(AgencySettings calldata agencySettings, AppSettings calldata appSettings, bytes calldata data)
        external
        returns (address, address);
}
```

## Rationale

### Prior Interfaces

[ERC-5679](./eip-5679.md) proposed `IERC5679Ext721` interface for introducing a consistent way to extend [ERC-721](./eip-721.md) token standards for minting and burning. To ensure the backward compatibility, considering some contracts which do not implement `ERC721TokenReceiver`, `IERC7527App` employ `mint` function instead of `safeMint`. To ensure the safety and the uniqueness of mutual bound, the `_from` parameter of the `burn` function in `IERC5679Ext721` must be the contract address of the bounded agency. Thus, `burn` function in `IERC7527App` does not contain the `_from` parameter. 

### Mutual Bound

Implement contracts for `IERC7527App` and `IERC7527Agency` so that they are each other's only owner. The wrap process is to check the premium amount of the fungible token received and then mint non-fungible token in the App. Only the owner or an approver of the non-fungible token can unwrap it.

### Implementation Diversity 

Users can customize function and fee percentage when implement the Agency and the App interfaces.

Different Agency implementations have distinct wrap, unwrap function logic, and different oracleFunction. Users can customize the currency, initial price, fee receiving address, fee rate, etc., to initialize the Agency contract. 

Different App implementations cater to various use cases. Users can initialize the App contract.

Factory is not required. Factory implementation is need-based. Users can deploy their own contracts by selecting different Agency implementations and different App implementations through the Factory, combining them to create various products.


### Currency types

`currency` in `IERC7527Agency` is the address of fungible token. `Asset` can only define one type of `currency` as the fungible token in the system. `currency` supports various kinds of fungible tokens including ETH and [ERC-20](./eip-20.md). 

### Token id

For each wrap process, a unique `tokenId` should be generated. This `tokenId` is essential for verification during the unwrap process. It also serves as the exclusive credential for the token. This mechanism ensures the security of assets in contracts. 

### Wrap and Mint

The `strategy` is set while implementing the Agency interface, and it should be ensured not upgradable once deployed.

When executing the `wrap` function, the predetermined strategy parameters are passed into the `getWrapOracle` function to fetch the current premium and fee. The respective premium is then transferred to the Agency instance; the fee, according to `mintFeePercent` is transferred to `feeRecipient`. Subsequently, the App mints the NFT to the user's address.

Premium(tokens) transferred into the Agency cannot be moved, except through the unwrap process. The act of executing wrap is the sole trigger for the mint process. 

### Unwrap and Burn

When executing the `unwrap` function, predetermined strategy parameters are passed into the `getUnwrapOracle` function to read the current premium and fee. The App burns the NFT. Then, the corresponding premium, subtracting the fee according to `burnFeePercent`, is then transferred to the user's address; the fee is transferred to `feeRecipient`. The act of executing 'unwrap' is the sole trigger for the 'burn' process.

### Two interfaces use together

`IERC7527App` and `IERC7527Agency` can be implemented together for safety, but they can be independently implemented before initialization for flexibiliy.

### Pricing

`getWrapOracle` and `getUnwrapOracle` are used to fetch the current premium and fee. They implement on-chain price fetching through oracle functions. They not only support fetching the premium and fee during the wrap and unwrap processes but also support other contracts calling them to obtain the premium and fee, such as lending contracts.

They can support function oracle based on on-chain and off-chain parameters, but on-chain parameters are suggested only for consensus of on-chain reality.

### `initData` and `iconstructor`

During the deployment of `App` and `Agency` by the Factory, the Factory uses `initData` as Calldata to call the `Agency` and `App` contracts and also invokes the `iconstructor` functions within `App` and `Agency`. 

The initData is mainly used to call the parameterized initialization functions, while `iconstructor` is often used to validate configuration parameters and non-parameterized initialization functions.

## Backwards Compatibility

No backward compatibility issues found.

## Security Considerations

### Fraud Prevention

Consider the following for the safety of the contracts:

* Check whether modifiers `onlyAgency()` and `onlyApp()` are proporly implemented and applied.

* Check the function strategies.

* Check whether the contracts can be subject to re-entrancy attack.

* Check whether all non-fungible tokens can be unwrapped with the premium calculated from FOAMM.
