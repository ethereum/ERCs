## Abstract  

This EIP proposes a standard for creating economically sustainable NFT collections based on [ERC-721](erc-721.md). It introduces dynamic minting fees, role-based access control, and a donation-based engagement model to enhance creator-community interactions. These mechanisms aim to balance scarcity, incentivize meaningful participation, and ensure sustainable growth for both creators and contributors.


### Motivation  
---

NFT systems often face issues like inflationary supply and lack of mechanisms to incentivize meaningful engagement between creators and contributors. This EIP addresses these gaps by introducing:  
- **Dynamic Minting Fees**: To align token costs with user activity and ownership.  
- **Donation-Based Engagement**: Encouraging contributions to creators.  
- **Role-Based Access**: Empowering creators while ensuring transparent governance.  


## Specification  

### Core Functionalities  

1. **Dynamic Minting Fees:**  
   The minting fee is dynamically adjusted using a logarithmic formula that reduces the fee over time based on the user’s minting activity. This approach encourages frequent engagement and makes NFT minting more accessible to active users.
   - Formula:  
     ```solidity
      function mintFee() public view returns (uint256) {
          if (hasRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, msg.sender)) return 0;
          uint256 userMints = mintsPerUserInCycle[msg.sender];
          uint256 divisor = userMints == 0 ? 1 : Math.log2(userMints + 2);
          return mintBaseFee / divisor;
      }
     ```  
    Mints are increasing and when the user reaches the maximum minting per cycle the count restarts. 
    - Mint:
    ```solidity
    function safeMint(string memory uri)
        public
        payable
        override 
        onlyIfNotPaused
        nonReentrant
        onlyRole(CREATOR_ROLE)
    {
        bool userMintsExceeded = mintsPerUserInCycle[msg.sender] + 1 > maxMintsPerUserInCycle;

        require(msg.value >= mintFee(), "Not enough ETH!");

        uint256 tokenId = currentTokenId++;
        _safeMint(msg.sender, tokenId);
        _setTokenURI(tokenId, uri);

        if(userMintsExceeded){
            mintsPerUserInCycle[msg.sender] = 0;
        }
        mintsPerUserInCycle[msg.sender]++;
    }
    ```

2. **Donation System:**  
  Contributors can support creators by donating ETH. After donating, users can receive the CONTRIBUTOR_ROLE, and the DonationReceived event is emitted to provide transparency. This incentivizes contributions, creates a sense of belonging for those who support creators, and builds stronger ties within the ecosystem.
   - Function:  
     ```solidity
      function donate(address creator) 
      public
      payable 
      override 
      {
          require(hasRole(CREATOR_ROLE, creator), "Address is not a valid creator!");
          require(creator != msg.sender, "You can't donate to yourself!");
          require(msg.value > 0, "Value must be greater than zero");

          payable(creator).transfer(msg.value);
          _grantRole(CONTRIBUTOR_ROLE, msg.sender);
          emit DonationReceived(msg.sender, creator, msg.value);
      }
     ```

3. **Role-Based Access:**  
  **CREATOR_ROLE**: Grants minting and collection management privileges. Users can acquire this role by paying a creator signature fee.
  **CONTRIBUTOR_ROLE**: Granted to users who donate ETH to creators, encouraging support for creators’ work.
  **DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE**: Manages roles, updates contract terms, and handles withdrawals. 


4. **Administrative Controls:**  

    **Pause/Unpause**: Enables administrators to halt or resume contract operations in emergencies.

    **Withdraw**: Administrators can withdraw ETH from the contract.

    **Update Terms**: Allows the admin to update contract terms *mintBaseFee*, *creatorSignatureFee*, *maxMintsPerUserInCycle*. `IMPORTANT:` Updates not available until contract update interval is reached. Default *UPDATE_INTERVAL* is *30 days*.

## Rationale  

Below are the key considerations and justifications for the design choices:

1. **Dynamic Minting Fees**  
   - **Problem**: Fixed minting fees often lead to hoarding and disproportionate ownership, limiting equitable access to NFTs.  
   - **Solution**: By dynamically adjusting minting fees based on user activity, we ensure that users are incentivized to engage with the platform by receiving gradual discounts as they mint. Using a logarithmic reduction in minting fees ensures that the process is gradual, preventing market manipulation and maintaining scarcity over time.

2. **Donation-Based Engagement**  
   - **Problem**: Creators often lack sustainable models for fostering community engagement and receiving contributions.  
   - **Solution**: The donation system provides a transparent way for contributors to support their favorite creators directly. This can be used to attribute benefits in future trades, for example. This encourages deeper engagement and strengthens the relationship between creators and their communities.

### Backwards Compatibility  

This EIP is fully compatible with ERC-721. Extensions like dynamic minting fees, donation systems are modular and do not impact existing ERC-721 token functionalities.

---

### Test Cases  

- Validate minting behavior, including fee calculations based on user mint history.
- Ensure correct ETH transfers to creators and that the CONTRIBUTOR_ROLE is assigned properly.
- Verify mint fee adjustments based on user activity.
- Confirm that contract functions are correctly paused during an emergency.
- Test access control, ensuring only authorized roles can mint, donate, or update the contract.
- Verify that only the token owner can burn their token.

## Security Considerations  

- **Reentrancy Protection:**  
  The contract uses the *nonReentrant* modifier from OpenZeppelin to protect against reentrancy attacks, particularly in functions that involve ETH transfers.
- **Access Management:**  
  The contract utilizes OpenZeppelin's AccessControl to enforce strict role-based restrictions, ensuring that only authorized users can mint, donate, or update contract parameters.
- **Donation Transparency:**  
  Donations made through the contract are fully transparent. The donation system ensures that all ETH transfers are logged, and the **DonationReceived** event allows both contributors and creators to track the contributions in real-time.
- **Paused State:**  
  Administrators can pause the contract during emergencies to prevent unwanted operations and mitigate risks during uncertain times.
- **Burning Security:**
  Only the owner of a token can burn it, reducing the risk of malicious contracts or unauthorized users destroying tokens belonging to others. The burn behavior is restricted to the ownership function, enhancing security by preventing accidental or abusive token destruction.
