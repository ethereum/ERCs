## Abstract  

This EIP proposes a standard for creating economically sustainable NFT collections based on ERC721. It introduces dynamic minting fees, role-based access control, and a donation-based engagement model to enhance creator-community interactions. These mechanisms aim to balance scarcity, incentivize meaningful participation, and ensure sustainable growth for both creators and contributors.


### Motivation  
---

NFT systems often face issues like inflationary supply and lack of mechanisms to incentivize meaningful engagement between creators and contributors. This EIP addresses these gaps by introducing:  
- **Dynamic Minting Fees**: To align token costs with user activity and ownership.  
- **Donation-Based Engagement**: Encouraging contributions to creators.  
- **Role-Based Access**: Empowering creators while ensuring transparent governance.  


## Specification  
The keywords "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

1. **Variables and Constants**
    #### `mintBaseFee`
    **Type**: `uint256`  
    **Description**:  
    The base fee for minting a token, paid by the user to create a new token.

    #### `creatorSignatureFee`
    **Type**: `uint256`  
    **Description**:  
    The fee required for a user to acquire a creator's signature, allowing them to become a creator in the system.

    #### `maxMintsPerUserInCycle`
    **Type**: `uint256`  
    **Description**:  
    The maximum number of mints a user can perform in a cycle. Once the limit is exceeded, the user's minting count is reset.

    #### `lastUpdateTimestamp`
    **Type**: `uint256`  
    **Description**:  
    Timestamp of the last time the contract terms were updated (e.g., minting fees and creator signature fees). It is used to determine when the contract's terms can be updated again.

    #### `UPDATE_INTERVAL`
    **Type**: `uint256` (constant)  
    **Description**:  
    The time interval between contract terms updates. **MUST** be fixed to <ins>30 days</ins>.

    #### `CREATOR_ROLE`
    **Type**: `bytes32` (constant)  
    **Description**:  
    The role identifier for creators in the system. 

    #### `CONTRIBUTOR_ROLE`
    **Type**: `bytes32` (constant)  
    **Description**:  
    The role identifier for contributors in the system. 

    #### `mintsPerUserInCycle`
    **Type**: `mapping(address => uint256)`  
    **Description**:  
    A mapping that tracks the number of mints a user has performed in the current cycle. It is used to enforce the maximum minting limit per user.

    ---

2. **Events**
    #### `CreatorTermsUpdated(uint256 mintBaseFee, uint256 creatorSignatureFee, uint256 maxMintsPerUserInCycle)`
    **Description**:  
    Emitted when the contract terms related to minting are updated by the `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`.

    ---

    #### `DonationReceived(address from, address to, uint256 amount)`
    **Description**:  
    Emitted when a user donates ETH to a creator. This event tracks the details of the donation, including the donor's address, the recipient's address, and the donation amount.

    **Parameters**:  
    - `from`: The address of the user making the donation.  
    - `to`: The address of the creator receiving the donation.  
    - `amount`: The amount of ETH donated.


    ---

3. **Modifiers**
    #### `onlyIfNotPaused`
    **Description**:  
    Ensures that the contract **MUST NOT** be paused when executing a function.

    #### `onlyTokenOwner(uint256 tokenId)`
    **Description**:  
    Ensures that the caller is the owner of the specified token. This is checked by comparing the caller's address with the owner of the token identified by `tokenId`.


    #### `updateCooldown`
    **Description**:  
    Ensures that the function can only be executed after the update interval has passed since the last contract term update.
    ```solidity
    modifier updateCooldown() {
        require(
            block.timestamp >= lastUpdateTimestamp + UPDATE_INTERVAL, 
            "Updates not available until contract update interval is reached."
        );
        _;
    }
    ```

    ---

4. **Functions**
    #### `function safeMint(string memory uri)`
    **Type**: Public and `payable` function  
    **Description**:

    ```solidity
    function safeMint(string memory uri)
    public
    payable
    override 
    onlyIfNotPaused
    nonReentrant
    onlyRole(CREATOR_ROLE)
    {
        bool userMintsExceeded = mintsPerUserInCycle[msg.sender] + 1 > maxMintsPerUserInCycle;

        require(msg.value >= mintFee(), "Not enough ETH!");

        uint256 tokenId = currentTokenId++;
        _safeMint(msg.sender, tokenId);
        _setTokenURI(tokenId, uri);

        uint256 userMints = mintsPerUserInCycle[msg.sender];
        uint256 divisor = userMints == 0 ? 1 : Math.log2(userMints + 2);
        return mintBaseFee / divisor;
    }
    ```

    **Requirements**:

## Rationale  

Below are the key considerations and justifications for the design choices:

1. **Dynamic Minting Fees**  
   - **Problem**: Fixed minting fees often lead to hoarding and disproportionate ownership, limiting equitable access to NFTs.  
   - **Solution**: By dynamically adjusting minting fees based on user activity within defined minting cycles, we ensure that users are incentivized to engage with the platform by receiving gradual discounts as they mint. Using a logarithmic reduction in minting fees ensures that the process is gradual, preventing market manipulation and maintaining scarcity over time.

2. **Donation-Based Engagement**  
   - **Problem**: Creators often lack sustainable models for fostering community engagement and receiving contributions.  
   - **Solution**: The donation system provides a transparent way for contributors to support their favorite creators directly. This can be used to attribute benefits in future trades, for example. This encourages deeper engagement and strengthens the relationship between creators and their communities.

---

### Backwards Compatibility  

This EIP is fully compatible with ERC721. Extensions like dynamic minting fees, donation systems are modular and do not impact existing ERC721 token functionalities.

---

### Test Cases  

- Validate minting behavior, including fee calculations based on user mint history.
- Ensure correct ETH transfers to creators and that the CONTRIBUTOR_ROLE is assigned properly.
- Verify mint fee adjustments based on user activity.
- Confirm that contract functions are correctly paused during an emergency.
- Test access control, ensuring only authorized roles can mint, donate, or update the contract.
- Verify that only the token owner can burn their token.

---

### Reference Implementation  
Every ERC-7832 compliant contract **MUST** implement ERC721 and the ERC7832 interfaces.

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;


interface IERC7832 {
    
    // Events
    event CreatorTermsUpdated(
        uint256 mintBaseFee,
        uint256 creatorSignatureFee,
        uint256 maxMintsPerUserInCycle);

    event DonationReceived(address from, address to, uint256 amount);

    // Function to get CREATOR_ROLE
    function getCreatorSignature() external payable;

    // Allow users to donate ETH to a specific creator in the system.
    function donate(address creator) external payable;

    // Allow users to check their mint fee
    function mintFee() external view returns (uint256);

    // Allow DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE pause the contract
    function pause() external;

    // Allow DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE unpause the contract
    function unpause() external;

    // Allow CREATOR_ROLE to mint
    function safeMint(string memory uri) external payable;

    // Allow DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE to update contract terms
    function updateTerms(
        uint256 mintBaseFee,
        uint256 creatorSignatureFee,
        uint256 maxMintsPerUserInCycle
    ) external;

    // Allow DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE to withdraw funds from the contract
    function withdraw(uint256 amount) external;

}
```

## Security Considerations  

OpenZeppelin contracts such as `ReentrancyGuard`, `Burnable`, `AccessControl`, `Pausable` are **RECOMMENDED** for implementations.

- **Reentrancy Protection:**  
  The OpenZeppelin's ReentrancyGuard would offer protection against reentrancy attacks.
- **Access Management:**  
  The OpenZeppelin's AccessControl would help with the roles.
- **Paused State:**  
  The OpenZeppelin's Pausable would help Administrators to pause the contract during emergencies to prevent unwanted operations and mitigate risks during uncertain times.
- **Burning Security:**
  The OpenZeppelin's Burnable would ensure that only the owner of a token can burn it, reducing the risk of malicious contracts or unauthorized users destroying tokens belonging to others. The burn behavior is restricted to the ownership function, enhancing security by preventing accidental or abusive token destruction.
