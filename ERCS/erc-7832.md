## Abstract  

This EIP proposes a standard for creating economically sustainable NFT governance for collections built on collaborative models based on [ERC-721](./eip-721.md). It introduces dynamic minting fees, role-based access control, and a donation-based engagement model to enhance creator-community interactions. These mechanisms aim to balance scarcity, incentivize meaningful participation, and ensure sustainable growth for both creators and contributors.

The model defines "economically sustainable" as tokens whose minting value, creator subscription fees, and token quantity within each progressive discount cycle can only be adjusted once every 30 days from the last update by an `ADMIN` user. These mechanisms prevent excessive administrative modifications that could disrupt market stability, ensuring consistent price discovery and maintaining participant confidence. By aligning incentives and fostering predictability, the model creates a robust framework for engagement and value creation.

### Motivation  


As the NFT market matures, one of the recurring challenges faced by both creators and users is the inflationary nature of supply and the lack of effective mechanisms to engage the community meaningfully. NFT collections built on collaborative models require governance systems that empower all stakeholders—creators, contributors, and collectors—while also maintaining long-term economic sustainability. The introduction of this proposal aims to solve these issues by fostering a more dynamic, flexible, and transparent system for NFT collections. This EIP addresses these gaps by introducing:  
- **Role-Based Access**: Empowering creators while ensuring transparent governance by admins.  
- **Dynamic Minting Fees**: To align token costs with user activity and ownership.  
- **Donation-Based Engagement**: Encouraging contributions to creators.

Timestamp of the last time the contract terms were updated (e.g., minting fees and creator signature fees). It is used to determine when the contract's terms can be updated again.

#### `UPDATE_INTERVAL()`

## Rationale  

Below are the key considerations and justifications for the design choices:

1. **Access Control**
   - **Problem**: In collaborative NFT systems, it is essential to ensure that critical contract functions are executed only by authorized users to prevent misuse or manipulation. Without proper access control, there is a risk that anyone could modify key parameters, such as minting fees, terms, or contract pauses, which could lead to instability or unfair advantages for certain users.
   - **Solution**: By introducing role-based access control, this standard ensures that only trusted actors can perform sensitive actions. Admins are responsible for updating contract terms, pausing or unpausing the contract, and withdrawing funds, while creators can manage their own collections and get donations. This prevents arbitrary changes that might harm market stability or erode community trust.

2. **Dynamic Minting Fees**  
   - **Problem**: Fixed minting fees often lead to hoarding and disproportionate ownership, limiting equitable access to NFTs.  
   - **Solution**: By dynamically adjusting minting fees based on user activity within defined <u>minting cycles</u>, we ensure that users are incentivized to engage with the platform by receiving <u>gradual discounts as they mint</u>. Using a logarithmic reduction in minting fees ensures that the process is gradual, preventing market manipulation and maintaining scarcity over time.

3. **Donation-Based Engagement**  
   - **Problem**: Creators often lack sustainable models for fostering community engagement and receiving contributions.  
   - **Solution**: The donation system provides a transparent way for contributors to support their favorite creators directly. This can be used to attribute benefits in future trades, for example. This encourages deeper engagement and strengthens the relationship between creators and their communities.



### Backwards Compatibility  

This EIP is fully compatible with ERC-721. Extensions like dynamic minting fees, donation systems are modular and do not impact existing NFT token functionalities.



### Reference Implementation 

#### `mintFee()`
```solidity
function mintFee() public view returns (uint256) {
    if (hasRole(ADMIN_ROLE, msg.sender)) return 0;
    uint256 userMints = mintsPerUserInCycle(msg.sender);
    uint256 divisor = userMints <= 1 ? 1 : Math.log2(userMints);
    return mintBaseFee / divisor;
}
```

#### `safeMint(string memory uri)`
```solidity
function safeMint(string memory uri)
public
payable
override 
onlyIfNotPaused
nonReentrant
onlyRole(CREATOR_ROLE)
{
    bool userMintsExceeded = mintsPerUserInCycle(msg.sender) + 1 > maxMintsPerUserInCycle;

    require(msg.value >= mintFee(), "Not enough ETH!");

    uint256 tokenId = currentTokenId++;
    _safeMint(msg.sender, tokenId);
    _setTokenURI(tokenId, uri);

    if(userMintsExceeded){
        mintsPerUserInCycle(msg.sender) = 0;
    }
    mintsPerUserInCycle(msg.sender)++;
}
```


## Security Considerations  

- **Reentrancy Protection:**  
  Is **RECOMMENDED** to make sure the functions `safeMint`, `withdraw` and `donate` are protected against reentrancy attacks.
- **Paused State:**  
  The Administrators **MUST** be able to pause the contract during emergencies to prevent unwanted operations and mitigate risks during uncertain times.
- **Burning Security:**
  Ensure that only the owner of a token can burn it, reducing the risk of malicious contracts or unauthorized users destroying tokens belonging to others. The burn behavior is restricted to the ownership function, enhancing security by preventing accidental or abusive token destruction.
