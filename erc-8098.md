## Abstract

This ERC specifies **ZW-Token**, an ERC-20–compatible fungible token with a **strictly non-increasing total supply**. Once deployed, a ZW-Token contract provides **no mechanism to mint new tokens** or to restore tokens that have been burned.

The proposal achieves this by constraining implementations to (i) expose an **irreversible burn operation** that permanently reduces `totalSupply`, and (ii) **omit any minting functionality** from the contract interface and logic. As a result, the token maintains a **single canonical on-chain supply state** whose evolution is monotonically non-increasing over time.

This ERC does not attempt to regulate external wrappers or derivative contracts. Instead, it defines verifiable **invariants at the level of the canonical ERC-20 contract**, allowing users, auditors, and integrators to reason about supply behavior directly from on-chain state.

## Motivation

Most ERC-20 tokens in use today permit one or more of the following patterns:

* burns that can later be reversed via re-minting,
* supply restoration through privileged roles or upgrade paths,
* wrapped or synthetic abstractions that obscure the relationship between historical burns and effective circulating supply.

While these mechanisms are sometimes useful, they complicate supply reasoning and weaken the meaning of a burn as a final state transition. In particular:

* **Reclaimable burns** undermine trust assumptions, as token holders cannot distinguish between permanently destroyed supply and supply that may later be restored.
* **Reversible mint paths** introduce implicit governance or upgrade risk into what is otherwise perceived as a fungible asset.
* **Auditing and accounting** become more complex when the same burned units may reappear in the future or be mirrored synthetically.

ZW-Token is intended for use cases where a burn is meant to be **final and economically meaningful**, such as irreversible redemption, deflationary accounting, or systems that rely on provable upper bounds on future supply. By enforcing a non-increasing supply invariant at the contract level, this ERC enables simpler auditing, clearer economic guarantees, and stronger assumptions about long-term supply behavior.

## Specification

### Interface

This ERC introduces the following optional interface, which MAY be implemented by compliant contracts to explicitly signal adherence to the non-increasing supply invariant:

```solidity
interface IERC8098 {
    /// @notice Permanently destroys `amount` tokens from `from`, reducing total supply.
    /// @dev Implementations MUST ensure that burned tokens can never be re-minted.
    function burn(address from, uint256 amount) external;
}
```

Implementations that do not expose this interface MAY still conform to the invariant requirements below, but cannot be programmatically distinguished from generic ERC-20 tokens.

### Invariants

An ERC-8098–compliant contract MUST satisfy all of the following:

#### 1. Irreversible Burn

Calling `burn(address from, uint256 amount)` MUST:

* permanently reduce `totalSupply` by `amount`,
* emit a `Transfer(from, address(0), amount)` event,
* ensure that no future state transition can restore the burned units.

#### 2. Absence of Minting Capability

After deployment, the contract MUST NOT provide any function or upgrade path capable of:

* increasing `totalSupply`,
* restoring previously burned units,
* minting new units under any name or abstraction.

This includes direct mint functions, privileged administrative minting, and indirect minting via upgradeable logic.

#### 3. Canonical Supply State

All balances and the reported `totalSupply` MUST derive from a **single canonical ERC-20 state maintained by the contract itself**. This ERC does not attempt to prohibit external wrappers or derivatives; rather, it specifies that the canonical contract exposes no alternative or parallel internal supply representation.

### Optional Privacy Extensions

Implementations MAY include privacy or obfuscation mechanisms provided that:

* `totalSupply` remains accurate and publicly verifiable,
* no hidden or alternate internal supply accounting is introduced,
* burned units remain permanently removed from all internal representations.

## Rationale

The design choices in this ERC are guided by a single objective: making the supply behavior of a fungible token **simple, auditable, and final**.

* **No minting interface**: Excluding mint functionality entirely is simpler and more robust than attempting to constrain or govern it.
* **Irreversible burns**: Treating burns as terminal state transitions restores their economic meaning and avoids ambiguity.
* **Minimal interface surface**: The optional `IERC8098` interface provides an explicit signal without imposing additional complexity on ERC-20 tooling.
* **Limited scope**: By constraining only the canonical contract, the ERC remains enforceable while avoiding claims about off-chain or external behavior.

## Backwards Compatibility

ERC-8098 is fully backward compatible with ERC-20. Existing wallets, indexers, and DeFi protocols may interact with a ZW-Token as with any standard ERC-20 token.

## Security Considerations

Implementers must ensure that:

* no hidden mint paths exist,
* no upgrade or proxy mechanism can introduce minting functionality,
* the burn operation cannot be bypassed or reversed.

Failure to do so invalidates the non-increasing supply invariant and renders the implementation non-compliant.
