# ERC-8098: Non-increasing supply ERC-20

## Abstract

This ERC specifies **ZW-Token**, an ERC-20–compatible fungible token whose total supply is **strictly non-increasing**.

Once deployed, a ZW-Token contract provides **no mechanism to mint new tokens** or to restore tokens that have been burned. The only allowed supply transition is reduction via irreversible burn operations.

This proposal achieves its goal by constraining implementation behavior such that:  
(i) every burn permanently reduces `totalSupply`, and  
(ii) no minting or supply-restoration logic exists, whether directly, indirectly, or via upgrade mechanisms.

Optional privacy techniques may be applied **only** as transaction-level obfuscation and must not introduce alternate or synthetic supply representations.

## Motivation

Most ERC-20 tokens in use today permit one or more of the following patterns:

- burns that can later be reversed via re-minting,
- wrapped or synthetic representations that mirror supply off the canonical contract,
- upgradeable logic that may introduce new mint paths after deployment.

While these patterns are useful in many contexts, they complicate auditing and make it difficult to reason about long-term supply invariants.

A strictly non-increasing supply token is desirable when:

- burned units are intended to represent permanent value destruction,
- supply monotonicity must be verifiable on-chain,
- integrators and auditors require a single, canonical supply state.

ZW-Token formalizes these expectations by defining a supply model where burns are terminal and no alternate supply representations are permitted.

## Specification

### 1. Irreversible Burn

Implementations MUST provide a burn mechanism such that calling:


results in:

- a permanent reduction of `totalSupply`,
- emission of a `Transfer(from, address(0), amount)` event,
- no possible future operation that restores the burned units.

### 2. No Re-Mint Path

Implementations MUST NOT include any function or mechanism capable of:

- increasing `totalSupply` after deployment,
- reissuing burned tokens,
- minting synthetic or substitute units representing burned supply.

### 3. Single Canonical Supply State

All balances and supply accounting MUST reference a single ERC-20 state.

This ERC does not attempt to regulate external wrappers or off-chain abstractions; however, any implementation claiming compliance with ERC-8098 MUST ensure that the canonical ERC-20 contract itself contains no logic that mirrors, offsets, or reconstructs supply.

### 4. Optional Privacy Layer

Privacy extensions MAY be included only if they:

- do not modify `totalSupply`,
- do not maintain alternate balance trees,
- do not create private or synthetic representations of burned units.

## Rationale

The design choices in this ERC are driven by the requirement that supply behavior be simple, auditable, and final.

- Prohibiting re-minting removes ambiguity around burn semantics.
- Enforcing a single canonical supply state prevents divergence between wrapped or mirrored representations.
- Disallowing upgrade paths that introduce minting logic preserves the monotonicity of supply over time.

These constraints intentionally limit flexibility in exchange for stronger guarantees.

## Backwards Compatibility

ERC-8098 is fully compatible with ERC-20.

Existing wallets, indexers, and DeFi infrastructure may treat an ERC-8098 token as a standard ERC-20, with the additional guarantee that its total supply will never increase.

## Security Considerations

Implementers MUST ensure that:

- no hidden mint paths exist,
- no upgrade or proxy mechanism can introduce minting functionality,
- the burn operation cannot be bypassed or reversed.

Failure to do so invalidates the non-increasing supply invariant and renders the implementation non-compliant.
