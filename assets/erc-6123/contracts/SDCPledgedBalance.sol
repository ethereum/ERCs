/**
 * @title Reference Implementation of ERC6123 - Smart Derivative Contract
 * @notice This reference implementation is based on a finite state machine with predefined trade and process states (see enums below)
 * Some comments on the implementation:
 * - trade and process states are used in modifiers to check which function is able to be called at which state
 * - trade data are stored in the contract
 * - trade data matching is done in incept and confirm routine (comparing the hash of the provided data)
 * - ERC-20 token is used for three participants: counterparty1 and counterparty2 and sdc
 * - when prefunding is done sdc contract will hold agreed amounts and perform settlement on those
 * - sdc also keeps track on internal balances for each counterparty
 * - during prefunding sdc will transfer required amounts to its own balance - therefore sufficient approval is needed
 * - upon termination all remaining 'locked' amounts will be transferred back to the counterparties
 *------------------------------------*
     * Setup with Pledge Account
     *
     *  Settlement:
     *  _bookSettlement
     *      Update internal balances
     *      Message
     *  Rebalance:
     *      Book Party2 -> Party1:   X
     *      Rebalance Check
     *          Failed
     *              Book SDC -> Party1:   X
     *              Terminate
