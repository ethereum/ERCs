/*------------------------------------------- DESCRIPTION ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * @title ERC6123 - Settlement Token Interface
 * @dev Settlement Token Interface enhances the ERC20 Token by introducing an asynchronous (checked) transfer functionality which can be used to directly interact with an SDC.
 * Transfers can be conducted for single or multiple transactions where SDC will receive a success message whether the transfer was executed successfully or not.
 * The SDC or callbackContract needs to implemnt a function afterTransfer(bool success, uint256 transactionID, string memory transactionData)
