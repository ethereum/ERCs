/**
 * @title Reference Implementation of ERC6123 - Abstract Class for OTC Derivatives
 * @notice This reference implementation is based on a finite state machine with predefined trade and process states (see enums below)
 * Some comments on the implementation:
 * - trade and process states are used in modifiers to check which function is able to be called at which state
 * - trade data are stored in the contract
 * - trade data matching is done in incept and confirm routine (comparing the hash of the provided data)
 * - A Settlement Token (based on ERC20) is used for settlement able to process batched transfers
 * - upon termination all remaining 'locked' amounts will be transferred back to the counterparties
