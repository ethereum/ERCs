# Pre-sign report executable assets

From this directory, install the pinned test library and run:

```sh
mkdir -p lib
git clone --depth 1 --branch v1.17.0 https://github.com/foundry-rs/forge-std.git lib/forge-std
git -C lib/forge-std checkout f3dae6e6ee381f25eb6a246f7da9b85c91a68219
forge test
```

Validated with Forge 1.7.1, Solidity 0.8.30, EVM Prague, and the forge-std commit above:
31 tests pass (14 existing delegate vectors, 12 anchor cases, 5 historical-signer
cases). Each of the two fuzz tests runs 256 cases. No RPC is required.

## Candidate anchor implementation

`PresignReportAnchor` implements the draft's `IPresignReportAnchor`. First publication
is keyed by `(msg.sender, reportHash)`. Repeated publication emits the event but
cannot move the original timestamp or block number; another caller gets a separate
record. There is no owner, upgrade path, caller allowlist or funds handling.

Use `PresignReportAnchor` only on a chain where `block.number` is that chain's own
block number. On Arbitrum chains, use `ArbitrumPresignReportAnchor`, which reads
`ArbSys(address(100)).arbBlockNumber()` and reverts if that read is unavailable. The
choice is explicit at deployment; there is no chain-ID allowlist or runtime fallback
to the wrong clock. The Arbitrum test stubs ArbSys; it is not an Arbitrum fork test.

Tests cover caller isolation, independent reports, repeat publication, event fields,
zero hashes, the 512-byte URI limit, a zero timestamp, checked 64-bit clock conversion,
and the Arbitrum clock. The contract records publication only: a consumer still checks
report content, signatures, identity binding, trusted history and chain canonicality.
Neither contract has been deployed as part of this contribution.

## Historical-signer vectors

The signer tests use real EIP-712 signatures, a rotating ERC-1271 test signer, the
candidate anchor, and a small owner/wallet registry fixture. Foundry snapshot replay
models reading an earlier registry state. Fixed input hashes stand in for canonical
report JSON; this is not a complete report verifier or an archive RPC implementation.

The cases show:

- Clearing a wallet or transferring ownership rejects the old current binding,
  while a report anchored when the key was bound still has that historical binding.
- Adding a binding later cannot retroactively authorize an earlier anchoring.
- The EIP-712 domain uses the registry chain, even when the anchor is on another chain.
- Rotating the key inside an ERC-1271 signer leaves the registry binding unchanged,
  but today's `isValidSignature` rejects the old report. Replaying the signature
  check in the earlier state accepts it.

The last case is now normative: when auditing an anchored report, step 2 runs at the same
historical block as step 3, both whether the signer has code (EIP-7702 can change it) and the
ERC-1271 `isValidSignature` call. A verifier without archive state treats the report as not
read, not as unsigned. Pre-sign checks still use current state.

Cross-chain timestamp-to-block selection, reorg handling, archive unavailability,
and historical content-addressed/mutable registration files are outside this harness.

The pre-existing `PreSignDelegateVectors.t.sol` remains MIT-licensed by it44. New
anchor and historical-signer assets are CC0-1.0. The delegate vectors are unchanged.
